film or motion picture the crew is distinguished from the cast as the cast are understood to be the actors who appear in front of the camera or provide voices for characters in the film the crew is also separate from the producers as the producers are the ones who own a portion of either the film company or the films intellectual property rights a film crew is divided into different departments each of which specializes in a specific aspect of the production film crew positions have evolved over the years spurred by technological change but many traditional jobs date from the early 20th century and are common across jurisdictions and film-making cultures motion picture projects have three discrete stages development production and distribution within the production stage there are also three clearly defined sequential phases pre-production principal photography and post-production and many film crew positions are associated with only one or two of the phases distinctions are

crew involved only with the production stage director edit a film director is a person who directs the making of a film the director most often has the highest authority on a film set generally a film

role in choosing the cast members production design and the creative aspects of filmmaking  1 under european union law the director is viewed as the author of the film  2 the film director gives direction to the cast and crew and creates an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized or noticed directors need to be able to mediate differences in creative visions and stay within the boundaries of the films budget there are many pathways to becoming a film director 3 some film directors started as screenwriters cinematographers film editors or actors other film directors have attended a film school directors use different approaches some outline a general plotline and let the actors improvise dialogue while others control every aspect and demand that the actors and crew follow instructions precisely some directors also write their own screenplays or collaborate on screenplays with long-standing writing partners some directors edit or appear in their films or compose the music score for their films  4 production edit production is generally not considered a department as such but rather as a series of functional groups these include the films

character effects in-betweeners cleanup and so on in traditional animation the nature of the medium meant that everything was literally flattened into the drawn lines and solid colors that became the characters making nearly all live-action positions irrelevant because animation has traditionally been so labor-intensive and thus expensive animation films normally have a separate story department in which storyboard artists painstakingly develop scenes to make sure they make sense before they are actually animated however since the turn of the 21st century modern 3d computer graphics and computer animation have made possible a level of rich detail never seen before many animated films now have specialized artists and animators who act as the virtual equivalent of lighting technicians grips costume designers props masters set decorators set dressers and cinematographers they make artistic decisions strongly similar to those of their live-action counterparts but implement them in a virtual space that exists only in software rather than on a physical set there have been major breakthroughs in the simulation of hair since 2005 meaning that hairstylists have been called in since then to consult on a few animation projects

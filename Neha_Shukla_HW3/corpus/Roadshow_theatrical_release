roadshow theatrical release wikipedia roadshow redirects here for the media company in hong kong see roadshow for the media company in australia see village roadshow for the similar term road show see road show a roadshow theatrical release known also as reserved seat engagement was a term in the motion picture industry for a practice in which a film opened in a limited number of theaters in large cities like new york city los angeles chicago and other major cities around the world for a specific period of time before the nationwide general release although variants of roadshow releases occasionally still exist the practice mostly ended in the early 1970s as far as is known virtually all of the films given roadshow releases were subsequently distributed to regular movie theatres this was called a general release and was akin to the modern-day wide release of a film however there are five important differences between a roadshow presentation of a film and todays limited releases roadshow theatrical releases almost always placed a ten to fifteen-minute intermission between the two acts of the film and the first act was frequently longer than the second films shown as roadshow releases especially those made between 1952 and 1974 were nearly always longer than the usual motion picture lasting anywhere from slightly more than two hours to four hours or more counting the intermission examples include ben-hur 1959 or cleopatra 1963 there were no short subjects accompanying the film and rarely any movie trailers roadshow presentations were always shown on a one or two-performance a day reserved seat basis and admission prices were always higher than those of regular screenings unlike todays limited releases seats had to be reserved one could not simply buy a ticket at the box office and go in to watch the film the two-performance-a-day screenings were usually limited to wednesdays saturdays and sundays during the rest of the week the films would be shown only once a day however in the case of oklahoma there were three showings a day of the film on weekends rather than two souvenir programs were often available at roadshow presentations of films much as souvenir programs are made available when one goes to see the stage version of a play or musical these movie souvenir programs contained photos from the film photos and biographies of its cast and principal crew and information on how the film was made rather like todays extras on dvds in the days of frequent roadshow releases production companies and film distributors never used them to determine whether or not a film should be given a wide release as is done today occasionally when films perform poorly at the box office from the 1920s to the mid-1970s a roadshow release would always play widely after its original engagements this was true even of box office flops history edit 1910s to 1951 edit u s releases edit the roadshow format had been used since the days of silent films but the rise of widescreen and stereophonic sound in the 1950s made it especially attractive to studio executives who hoped to lure audiences away from television by presenting films in a way that an audience at that time could never hope to see at home possibly the first film ever shown in a roadshow engagement was the french film les amours de la reine elisabeth in america in 1912 a 53-minute motion picture which starred the legendary stage actress sarah bernhardt films shown in roadshow format before 1951 included silent epics such as the birth of a nation 1915 intolerance 1916 the covered wagon 1923 the hunchback of notre dame 1923 the ten commandments 1923 ben-hur 1925 the big parade 1925 and other films such as wings 1927 the first best picture academy award winner the jazz singer 1927 the first feature length part-talkie chicago 1927 the silent film based on the play that inspired the kander and ebb broadway musical and oscar-winning film show boat 1929 a part-talkie based not on the 1927 stage musical but on edna ferbers original novel from which the musical was adapted the desert song 1929 rio rita also 1929 hells angels 1930 howard hughes the sign of the cross 1932 grand hotel 1932 winner of the academy award for best picture the great ziegfeld 1936 in old chicago 1937 about the fire lost horizon 1937 gone with the wind 1939 fantasia 1940 for whom the bell tolls 1943 the song of bernadette 1943 this is the army shown in roadshow format only in its initial run other notable roadshows include since you went away 1944 the best years of our lives 1946 duel in the sun also 1946 mourning becomes electra 1947 joan of arc ingrid bergman 1948 samson and delilah 1949 a midsummer nights dream 1935 as was the 1951 religious epic quo vadis 1951 however the theatre exhibitors of quo vadis took the unusual step of opening the film in two new york theatres simultaneously where it was shown in roadshow format in one theatre while the other one ran the nearly three-hour film in the more conventional continuous performances manner selected notable british releases edit british films that were shown as roadshow attractions included henry v 1944 in england and 1946 in the u s hamlet 1948 the red shoes 1948 distinguishing features edit in a roadshow release an often large-scale epic film would open in larger cities in an engagement much like a theatrical play or musical often with components such as an overture the first act the intermission the entracte the second act and the exit music the overture should not be confused with the main title music the overture recorded on film without a picture and years later on tape was always played before the beginning of the film while the lights were still up and the curtains were still closed most movie theatres until the 1980s had curtains which covered the screen and which would open when the show actually began as the lights dimmed the overture ended the curtains opened and the film began with its main title music and opening credits likewise the exit music should not be confused with the end title music the exit music also recorded without a picture on film was always played after the end of the film while the lights were up and the curtains were closed as the lights came on the end title music ended the curtains closed and the exit music began examples edit an early example of this was gone with the wind 1939 running almost four hours in length the film was divided into the above components so that the film patron can experience the film as if they were seeing an actual play in a theater the original theatrical release of walt disney s fantasia presented in fantasound in selected large cities in the united states never had an overture intermission music or exit music still fantasia was first released in the roadshow format included an intermission in its first run and was originally presented without on-screen credits to perpetuate a concert-going experience—the printed souvenir program given out to patrons as they entered the theater presented the films credits the original new york run of the english-language film cyrano de bergerac 1950 starring jose ferrer and based on edmond rostand s 1897 french play was likewise presented in a roadshow format that is one or two performances a day although the film is only two hours long was not produced on a large budget and does not contain an intermission the 1951 show boat was also shown in a roadshow format in some theatres despite being less than two hours long and not having an intermission overture entracte or exit music 1950s to 1970s edit with the rise of television beginning in 1952 and continuing through the early 1970s studios tried to bring movie audiences back to theatres by making widescreen epics again using the roadshow formula films shot in 3d sometimes were also shown in a roadshow format as a result there was an avalanche of roadshow films during those decades often more than one in a single year among them were this is cinerama 1952 the robe 1953 oklahoma 1955 richard iii 1955 cinerama holiday 1955 helen of troy 1956 war and peace 1956 around the world in 80 days 1956 the ten commandments 1956 seven wonders of the world 1956 giant 1956 the bridge on the river kwai 1957 raintree county 1957 search for paradise 1957 windjammer 1958 south pacific

1972 the great waltz 1972 the cowboys 1972 man of la mancha 1972 lost horizon 1973 and a whole host of others not on this list not all of these post-1951 roadshow releases were hits several of them especially the musicals were box-office flops that cost the studios fortunes even if they had previously been hits as stage shows some of the films such as the olivier othello or the burton hamlet were not even designed to be box-office smashes as films but were merely meant to bring these productions to a wider public than could have seen them onstage much as american film theatre would do in the mid-1970s many of these newer roadshow releases including the disney sleeping beauty were shown in six-track stereophonic sound a then non-standard feature of motion pictures west side story 1961 although shown in 70mm and six track stereophonic sound was originally intended to be shown with intermission but was in most areas shown without one in order to increase the tension in the plot an idea recommended by the filmmakers themselves the original vhs release includes options for watching the two-and-a-half hour film both with and without a break in 1961 the king and i which had originally been shown in 35mm with four track stereophonic sound without an intermission was re-released in a 70mm format with an intermission remixed into six track stereophonic sound and shown in a roadshow format the film had originally been made in cinemascope 55 and through advances in technologu was now able to be re-released in a process called grandeur 70 many films made in the various larger widescreen processes such as todd ao mgm camera 65 and super panavision 70 were given roadshow presentations purely to show off the technology films made in three-camera cinerama always received roadshow releases for the same reason the special requirements needed to show films in cinerama a theatre with a huge ultra-curved screen three projectors running simultaneously and seven-track stereophonic sound made it impossible to show its films in wide release unless the picture was converted to standard one projector format i e panavision since most of those cut off the sides of the original combined picture eventually with the advent of anamorphic lenses a number of cinerama roadshows were able to be compressed onto normal 5-perf 70mm film and with the extra-wide screens installed normal 70mm theatres were able to play these reformatted cinerama titles exceptions edit there were some notable exceptions to the standard roadshow release format three of them shakespeare productions one was othello 1965 which was essentially a filmed visual record of the already famous laurence olivier 1964 london stage production shot in a movie studio but on enlarged stage settings the nearly three-hour color film made in panavision and shown in 35mm and mono sound in many areas was shown in 70mm and six-track stereophonic sound in exactly one engagement in london in 1966 being a film that lay somewhere between a photographed play and a true motion picture the film did not make sufficient use of the spectacular vistas that 1960s widescreen epics usually boasted in addition while it had no overture entracte music or exit music it was still shown on a two-performance-a-day basis with an intermission as nearly all roadshow releases were however it was shown in u s cinemas for an extremely limited release only two days in contrast to the customary and lengthy months-long engagements enjoyed by most roadshow films the same was true of the richard burton hamlet which was presented in the same type of extremely limited engagement as othello filmed over two days in a quickie black-and-white process called electronovision which resembled a 1960s videotaped broadcast this three hours plus production featured none of the epic features that were a standard of roadshow theatrical release no impressive scenery no gorgeous color no beautiful costumes or stereophonic sound only an intermission halfway through the performance it was not even strictly speaking a full-scale film version of the play but merely a visual recording of a performance of it at the lunt-fontanne theatre with a live audience at three hours and eleven minutes it was the longest film version of hamlet to that date another exception was franco zeffirellis hugely successful 1968 version of romeo and juliet which although photographed in beautiful settings and certainly having the look of an epic was shown in most areas in monaural sound although its three soundtrack albums were all made in stereo projected at a screen aspect ratio of 1.661 that is roughly the dimensions of todays average movie screen or hdtv screen not the very wide screens required for films made in ultra panavision cinemascope todd-ao or any of the other ultrawide processes invented in the 1950s meant that the film lacked many of the customary roadshow elements opf the period however the mexican release of the picture did feature a six-track stereo surround mix and was shown with its original 1.66 aspect ratio matted to a 2.2 in standard 70mm similarly the film version of james goldman s the lion in winter 1968 although a roadshow release filmed on location to qualify for the gorgeous color and beautiful scenery requirements instead of being released in 70mm and 6-track stereo sound even though it was shown in technicolor it was only from 35mm panavision anamorphic film and mono sound only in australia and in its 1973 london re-release was the picture shown in both 70mm and stereophonic sound 1971s nicholas and alexandra another roadshow release was also shown in 70mm 6-track only in europe while its u s release was in regular panavision with monophonic sound edited versions and restoration edit it was common practice for studios to cut some of these epics for general release in order for theaters to book more showings a day and present the film at reduced popular prices especially if the film ran longer than two hours sometimes this was done to a successful film such as south pacific but more often to one that had been a notable flop in an effort to make it a success on its second run as a result some of these films have not been seen in their entirety since their first release as the original edited footage is either missing or no longer exists with the work of film preservationists and restoration such roadshow flops as a midsummer nights dream 1935 mourning becomes electra 1947 joan of arc 1948 a star is born 1954 and fantasia 1940 along with the hugely successful films for whom the bell tolls 1943 spartacus lawrence of arabia and around the world in 80 days all of which had significant footage missing have been restored in recent years to match the filmmakers original intent however several extremely popular long films such as gone with the wind and the ten commandments have never been released in edited form and were nearly always shown on a two performance-a-day basis in old chicago which despite its roadshow presentation ran only 110 minutes was edited down to 95 minutes for general release but restored to its full length on dvd frequently unless the film was exceptionally long the intermission along with the overture entracte music and exit music would be eliminated when it went into general release in order to save twenty minutes and possibly squeeze in more showings and the film would be shown just like any other motion picture often too the souvenir programs that were a part of the roadshow release of the films were no longer given out during the wide release rise of the limited release edit the practice of roadshow presentation began dying out in the 1970s partly due to a string of costly box-office flops and partly due to the rise of the multiplex as multiplexes began to increase in number and as more and more skyscraper hotels and office buildings took the place of the oldtime movie palaces theatre exhibitors began showing long films in a more informal format francis ford coppola s oscar-winning epics the godfather 1972 and the godfather part ii 1974 for instance were made with mono sound shown without intermissions and were given more than two performances a day despite their extreme length stanley kubrick s barry lyndon 1975 was shown more than twice a day but did include an intermission although some very long films such as gone with the wind would always be shown with an intermission reserved seat showings of new films became extremely rare the last film musical to officially receive a reserved seat engagement was lost horizon 1973 a financial and critical disaster in the late 1970s only three films two popular and one a legendary disaster received a reserved seat engagement michael cimino made the successful film the deer hunter which was a commercial and critical success winning the oscar for best picture in its initial run it was enlarged to 70mm film and given a roadshow release francis ford coppola director of the godfather made apocalypse now another three-hour epic which garnered some favorable reviews and is now considered one of his best the film had a difficult production history and after five years of production it premiered in a u s reserved seat engagement in 70mm it became a great financial success and made even more money years later when the directors cut was released ciminos next film in 1980 was heavens gate which is infamous for being one of the biggest box office bombs ever it had a roadshow release and premiered in a 70mm version with an intermission the roadshow engagement was the shortest in history for only three theatres held the screenings its new york run lasted three days the toronto run was shown once and the los angeles engagement was cancelled one development that diminished the novelty of the modern roadshow release was that beginning with star wars 1977 stereophonic sound began to be used more and more in films even films that were not really big-budget spectaculars most films however were at that time still released only with mono sound jaws for example made a mere two years before star wars was originally released in this format although as late as in 1982 the hugely successful tootsie was also released with mono sound as was the 1983 best picture winner terms of endearment by about 1984 mono sound was abandoned completely in american films and stereo often the six-track variety finally became the norm by 1984 the entire roadshow format had also largely been abandoned as the rise of the multiplex and competition from cable tv and home video began forcing changes in the nature of film industry for example carmen 1984 an uncut two-and-a-half hour film version of the popular georges bizet opera was not released as a roadshow nor shown with an intermission despite the fact that the film was so faithful to the opera that it kept the stage versions original division into four acts the 1984 carmen was also filmed in six-track stereo and on location like many epics today a practice of first premiering a film in larger cities is more common mainly towards the end of the year in order to qualify for film award consideration including the academy awards such recent films that have gone the limited release route include million dollar baby 2004 the aviator 2004 march of the penguins 2005 and the disney film the princess and the frog 2009 these and other such limited release films eventually opened wide sometimes this is done to allow a film to receive a wide release shortly after the first of the year while qualifying for the previous years academy awards often smaller films often art and independent will receive an initial release in new york and los angeles and later expand to other cities based on results this is called platforming or a platform release occasionally roadshow releases are done for special event films in 2006 the film dreamgirls based on the broadway stage musical was given a three-theater road show release with reserved seats and program guides tickets were significantly higher priced than normal at 25 the film itself was not shown with an intermission in 2008 and 2009 the four-hour biopic che starring benicio del toro as che guevara was shown in a roadshow format for a limited time in a number of large cities quentin tarantino who remembers the roadshow era fondly released the hateful eight in selected theaters on christmas day before expanding into a wide release on december 30 2015 tarantino shot the film in anamorphic 70mm specifically the single-strip 6-track stereo cinerama format described above and managed to get the film booked in roughly 100 theaters worldwide that were in all but a few cases provided 70mm projectors and lenses to equip the theaters to cope with the cinerama format by the weinstein company to screen the film as the director intended deadline com referred to this release as a roadshow presentation as it included all the hallmarks of a traditional roadshow release including programs an overture an intermission and entré act and exit music

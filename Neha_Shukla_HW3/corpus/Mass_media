mass media wikipedia mass media redirects here for the video game company see mass media inc the mass media is a diversified collection of media technologies that reach a large audience via mass communication the technologies through which this communication takes place include a variety of outlets broadcast media transmit information electronically via such media as film radio recorded music or television digital media comprises both internet and mobile mass communication internet media comprise such services as email social media sites websites and internet-based radio and television many other mass media outlets have an additional presence on the web by such means as linking to or running tv ads online or distributing qr codes in outdoor or print media to direct mobile users to a website in this way they can utilise the easy accessibility and outreach capabilities the internet affords as thereby easily broadcast information throughout many different regions of the world simultaneously and cost-efficiently outdoor media transmit information via such media as ar advertising billboards blimps flying billboards signs in tow of airplanes placards or kiosks placed inside and outside buses commercial buildings shops sports stadiums subway cars or trains signs or skywriting print media transmit information via physical objects such as books comics magazines newspapers or pamphlets event organizing and public speaking can also be considered forms of mass media the organizations that control these technologies such as movie studios publishing companies and radio and television stations are also known as the mass media issues with definition in the late 20th century mass media could be classified into eight mass media industries books the internet magazines movies newspapers radio recordings and television the explosion of digital communication technology in the late 20th and early 21st centuries made prominent the question what forms of media should be classified as mass media for example it is controversial whether to include cell phones computer games such as mmorpgs and video games in the definition in the 2000s a classification called the seven mass media became popular in order of introduction they are print books pamphlets newspapers magazines etc from the late 15th century recordings gramophone records magnetic tapes cassettes cartridges cds and dvds from the late 19th century cinema from about 1900 radio from about 1910 television from about 1950 internet from about 1990 mobile phones from about 2000 each mass medium has its own content types creative artists technicians and business models for example the internet includes blogs podcasts web sites and various other technologies built atop the general distribution network the sixth and seventh media internet and mobile phones are often referred to collectively as digital media and the fourth and fifth radio and tv as broadcast media some argue that video games have developed into a distinct mass form of media while a telephone is a two-way communication device mass media communicates to a large group in addition the telephone has transformed into a cell phone which is equipped with internet access a question arises whether this makes cell phones a mass medium or simply a device used to access a mass medium the internet there is currently a system by which marketers and advertisers are able to tap into satellites and broadcast commercials and advertisements directly to cell phones unsolicited by the phones user this transmission of mass advertising to millions of people is another form of mass communication video games may also be evolving into a mass medium video games for example massively multiplayer online role-playing games mmorpgs such as runescape provide a common gaming experience to millions of users across the globe and convey the same messages and ideologies to all their users users sometimes share the experience with one another by playing online excluding the internet however it is questionable whether players of video games are sharing a common experience when they play the game individually it is possible to discuss in great detail the events of a video game with a friend one has never played with because the experience is identical to each the question then is whether this is a form of mass communication characteristics five characteristics of mass communication have been identified by sociologist john thompson of cambridge university c omprises both technical and institutional methods of production and distribution this is evident throughout the history of mass media from print to the internet each suitable for commercial utility involves the commodification of symbolic forms as the production of materials relies on its ability to manufacture and sell large quantities of the work as radio stations rely on their time sold to advertisements so too newspapers rely on their space for the same reasons s eparate contexts between the production and reception of information its reach to those far removed in time and space in comparison to the producers i nformation distribution a one to many form of communication whereby products are mass-produced and disseminated to a great quantity of audiences mass vs mainstream and alternative the term mass media is sometimes erroneously used as a synonym for mainstream media mainstream media are distinguished from alternative media by their content and point of view alternative media are also mass media outlets in the sense that they use technology capable of reaching many people even if the audience is often smaller than the mainstream in common usage the term mass denotes not that a given number of individuals receives the products but rather that the products are available in principle to a plurality of recipients mass vs local and speciality mass media are distinguished from local media by the notion that whilst mass media aims to reach a very large market such as the entire population of a country local media broadcasts to a much smaller population and area and generally focuses on regional news rather than global events a third type of media speciality media provide for specific demographics such as specialty channels on tv sports channels porn channels etc these definitions are not set in stone and it is possible for a media outlet to be promoted in status from a local media outlet to a global media outlet some local media which take an interest in state or provincial news can rise to prominence because of their investigative journalism and to the local regions preference of updates in national politics rather than regional news the guardian formerly known as the manchester guardian is an example of one such media outlet once a regional daily newspaper the guardian is currently a nationally respected paper forms of mass media broadcast a family listening to a crystal radio in the 1920s main articles radio and television the sequencing of content in a broadcast is called a schedule with all technological endeavours a number of technical terms and slang have developed please see the list of broadcasting terms for a glossary of terms used radio and television programs are distributed over frequency bands that in the united states are highly regulated such regulation includes determination of the width of the bands range licensing types of receivers and transmitters used and acceptable content cable television programs are often broadcast simultaneously with radio and television programs but have a more limited audience by coding signals and requiring a cable converter box at individual recipients locations cable also enables subscription -based channels and pay-per-view services a broadcasting organisation may broadcast several programs simultaneously through several channels frequencies for example bbc one and two on the other hand two or more organisations may share a channel and each use it during a fixed part of the day such as the cartoon network adult swim digital radio and digital television may also transmit multiplexed programming with several channels compressed into one ensemble when broadcasting is done via the internet the term webcasting is often used in 2004 a new phenomenon occurred when a number of technologies combined to produce podcasting podcasting is an asynchronous broadcast narrowcast medium adam curry and his associates the podshow are principal proponents of podcasting film main article film the term film encompasses motion pictures as individual projects as well as the field in general the name comes from the photographic film also called filmstock historically the primary medium for recording and displaying motion pictures many other terms for film exist such as motion pictures or just pictures and picture the silver screen photoplays the cinema picture shows flicks and most common movies films are produced by recording people and objects with cameras or by creating them using animation techniques or special effects films comprise a series of individual frames but when these images are shown in rapid succession an illusion of motion is created flickering between frames is not seen because of an effect known as persistence of vision whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after the source has been removed also of relevance is what causes the perception of motion a psychological effect identified as beta movement film is considered by many to be an important art form films entertain educate enlighten and inspire audiences any film can become a worldwide attraction especially with the addition of dubbing or subtitles that translate the film message films are also artifacts created by specific cultures which reflect those cultures and in turn affect them video games a video game is a computer -controlled game in which a video display such as a monitor or television is the primary feedback device the term computer game also includes games which display only text and which can therefore theoretically be played on a teletypewriter or which use other methods such as sound or vibration as their primary feedback device but there are very few new games in these categories there always must also be some sort of input device usually in the form of button joystick combinations on arcade games a keyboard and mouse trackball combination computer games a controller console games or a combination of any of the above also more esoteric devices have been used for input e g the players motion usually there are rules and goals but in more open-ended games the player may be free to do whatever they like within the confines of the virtual universe in common usage an arcade game refers to a game designed to be played in an establishment in which patrons pay to play on a per-use basis a computer game or pc game refers to a game that is played on a personal computer a console game refers to one that is played on a device specifically designed for the use of such while interfacing with a standard television set a video game or videogame has evolved into a catchall phrase that encompasses the aforementioned along with any game made for any other device including but not limited to advanced calculators mobile phones pdas etc audio recording and reproduction sound recording and reproduction is the electrical or mechanical re-creation or amplification of sound often as music this involves the use of audio equipment such as microphones recording devices and loudspeakers from early beginnings with the invention of the phonograph using purely mechanical techniques the field has advanced with the invention of electrical recording the mass production of the 78 record the magnetic wire recorder followed by the tape recorder the vinyl lp record the invention of the compact cassette in the 1960s followed by sonys walkman gave a major boost to the mass distribution of music recordings and the invention of digital recording and the compact disc in 1983 brought massive improvements in ruggedness and quality the most recent developments have been in digital audio players an album is a collection of related audio recordings released together to the public usually commercially the term record album originated from the fact that 78 rpm phonograph disc records were kept together in a book resembling a photo album the first collection of records to be called an album was tchaikovskys nutcracker suite release in april 1909 as a four-disc set by odeon records it retailed for 16 shillings —about 15 in modern currency a music video also promo is a short film or video that accompanies a complete piece of music most commonly a song modern music videos were primarily made and used as a marketing device intended to promote the sale of music recordings although the origins of music videos go back much further they came into their own in the 1980s when music television s format was based on them in the 1980s the term rock video was often used to describe this form of entertainment although the term has fallen into disuse music videos can accommodate all styles of filmmaking including animation live action films documentaries and non-narrative abstract film internet see also digital media the internet also known simply as the net or less precisely as the web is a more interactive medium of mass media and can be briefly described as a network of networks specifically it is the worldwide publicly accessible network of interconnected computer networks that transmit data by packet switching using the standard internet protocol ip it consists of millions of smaller domestic academic business and governmental networks which together carry various information and services such as email online chat file transfer and the interlinked web pages and other documents of the world wide web contrary to some common usage the internet and the world wide web are not synonymous the internet is the system of interconnected computer networks linked by copper wires fiber-optic cables wireless connections etc the web is the contents or the interconnected documents linked by hyperlinks and urls the world wide web is accessible through the internet along with many other services including e-mail file sharing and others described below toward the end of the 20th century the advent of the world wide web marked the first era in which most individuals could have a means of exposure on a scale comparable to that of mass media anyone with a web site has the potential to address a global audience although serving to high levels of web traffic is still relatively expensive it is possible that the rise of peer-to-peer technologies may have begun the process of making the cost of bandwidth manageable although a vast amount of information imagery and commentary i e content has been made available it is often difficult to determine the authenticity and reliability of information contained in web pages in many cases self-published the invention of the internet has also allowed breaking news stories to reach around the globe within minutes this rapid growth of instantaneous decentralized communication is often deemed likely to change mass media and its relationship to society cross-media means the idea of distributing the same message through different media channels a similar idea is expressed in the news industry as convergence many authors understand cross-media publishing to be the ability to publish in both print and on the web without manual conversion effort an increasing number of wireless devices with mutually incompatible data and screen formats make it even more difficult to achieve the objective create once publish many the internet is quickly becoming the center of mass media everything is becoming accessible via the internet rather than picking up a newspaper or watching the 10 oclock news people can log onto the internet to get the news they want when they want it for example many workers listen to the radio through the internet while sitting at their desk even the education system relies on the internet teachers can contact the entire class by sending one e-mail they may have web pages on which students can get another copy of the class outline or assignments some classes have class blogs in which students are required to post weekly with students graded on their contributions blogs web logs blogging too has become a pervasive form of media a blog is a website usually maintained by an individual with regular entries of commentary descriptions of events or interactive media such as images or video entries are commonly displayed in reverse chronological order with most recent posts shown on top many blogs provide commentary or news on a particular subject others function as more personal online diaries a typical blog combines text images and other graphics and links to other blogs web pages and related media the ability for readers to leave comments in an interactive format is an important part of many blogs most blogs are primarily textual although some focus on art artlog photographs photoblog sketchblog videos vlog music mp3 blog audio podcasting are part of a wider network of social media microblogging is another type of blogging which consists of blogs with very short posts rss feeds rss is a format for syndicating news and the content of news-like sites including major news sites like wired news-oriented community sites like slashdot and personal blogs it is a family of web feed formats used to publish frequently updated content such as blog entries news headlines and podcasts an rss document which is called a feed or web feed or channel contains either a summary of content from an associated web site or the full text rss makes it possible for people to keep up with web sites in an automated manner that can be piped into special programs or filtered displays podcast main article podcast a podcast is a series of digital-media files which are distributed over the internet using syndication feeds for playback on portable media players and computers the term podcast like broadcast can refer either to the series of content itself or to the method by which it is syndicated the latter is also called podcasting the host or author of a podcast is often called a podcaster mobile main article mobile media mobile phones were introduced in japan in 1979 but became a mass media only in 1998 when the first downloadable ringing tones were introduced in finland soon most forms of media content were introduced on mobile phones tablets and other portable devices and today the total value of media consumed on mobile vastly exceeds that of internet content and was worth over 31 billion dollars in 2007 source informa the mobile media content includes over 8 billion

entertainment and advertising services in japan mobile phone books are so popular that five of the ten best-selling printed books were originally released as mobile phone books similar to the internet mobile is also an interactive media but has far wider reach with 3.3 billion mobile phone users at the end of 2007 to 1.3 billion internet users source itu like email on the internet the top application on mobile is also a personal messaging service but sms text messaging is used by over 2.4 billion people practically all internet services and applications exist or have similar cousins on mobile from search to multiplayer games to virtual worlds to blogs mobile has several unique benefits which many mobile media pundits claim make mobile a more powerful media than either tv or the internet starting with mobile being permanently carried and always connected mobile has the best audience accuracy and is the only mass media with a built-in payment channel available to every user

may be general or special interest most often published daily or weekly the most important function of newspapers is to inform the public of significant events local newspapers inform local communities and include advertisements from local businesses and services while national newspapers tend to focus on a theme which can be exampled with the wall street journal as they offer news on finance and business related-topics the first printed newspaper was published in 1605 and the form has thrived even in the face of competition from technologies such as radio and television recent developments on the internet are posing major threats to its business model however paid circulation is declining in most countries and advertising revenue which makes up the bulk of a newspapers income is shifting from print to online some commentators nevertheless point out that historically new media such as radio and television did not entirely supplant existing outdoor media outdoor media is a form of mass media which comprises billboards signs placards placed inside and outside commercial buildings objects like shops buses flying billboards signs in tow of airplanes blimps skywriting ar advertising many commercial advertisers use this form of mass media when advertising in sports stadiums tobacco and alcohol manufacturers used billboards and other outdoor media extensively however in 1998 the master settlement agreement between the us and the tobacco industries prohibited the billboard advertising of cigarettes in a 1994 chicago-based study diana hackbarth and her colleagues revealed how tobacco- and alcohol-based billboards were concentrated in poor neighbourhoods in other urban centers alcohol and tobacco billboards were much more concentrated in african-american neighborhoods than in white neighborhoods purposes a panel in the newseum in washington d c shows the september 12 headlines in america and around the world mass media encompasses much more than just news although it is sometimes misunderstood in this way it can be used for various purposes advocacy both for business and social concerns this can include advertising marketing propaganda public relations and political communication entertainment traditionally through performances of acting music and tv shows along with light reading since the late 20th century also through video and computer games public service announcements and emergency alerts that can be used as political device to communicate propaganda to the public professions involving mass media journalism journalism is the discipline of collecting analyzing verifying and presenting information regarding current events trends issues and people those who practice journalism are known as journalists news -oriented journalism is sometimes described as the first rough draft of history attributed to phil graham because journalists often record important events producing news articles on short deadlines while under pressure to be first with their stories news media organizations usually edit and proofread their reports prior to publication adhering to each organizations standards of accuracy quality and style many news organizations claim proud traditions of holding government officials and institutions accountable to the public while media critics have raised questions about holding the press itself accountable to the standards of professional journalism public relations public relations is the art and science of managing communication between an organization and its key publics to build manage and sustain its positive image examples include corporations use marketing public relations to convey information about the products they manufacture or services they provide to potential customers to

made their fame from creating and promoting videos on the public video-sharing site youtube many youtube celebrities have made a profession from their site through sponsorships advertisements product placement and network support history early wooden printing press depicted in 1520 the history of mass media can be traced back to the days when dramas were performed in various ancient cultures this was the first time when a form of media was broadcast to a wider audience the first dated printed book known is the diamond sutra printed in china in 868 ad although it is clear that books were printed earlier movable clay type was invented in 1041 in china however due to the slow spread of literacy to the masses in china and the relatively high cost of paper there the earliest printed mass-medium was probably european popular prints from about 1400 although these were produced in huge numbers very few early examples survive and even most known to be printed before about 1600 have not survived the term mass media was coined with the creation of print media which is notable for being the first example of mass media as we use the term today this form of media started in europe in the middle ages johannes gutenberg s invention of the printing press allowed the mass production of books to sweep the nation he printed the first book a latin bible on a printing press with movable type in 1453 the invention of the printing press gave rise to some of the first forms of mass communication by enabling the publication of books and newspapers on a scale much larger than was previously possible the invention also transformed the way the world received printed materials although books remained too expensive really to be called a mass-medium for at least a century after that newspapers developed from about 1612 with the first example in english in 1620 but they took until the 19th century to reach a mass-audience directly the first high-circulation newspapers arose in london in the early 1800s such as the times and were made possible by the invention of high-speed rotary steam printing presses and railroads which allowed large-scale distribution over wide geographical areas the increase in circulation however led to a decline in feedback and interactivity from the readership making newspapers a more one-way medium the phrase the media began to be used in the 1920s the notion of mass media was generally restricted to print media up until the post-second world war when radio television and video were introduced the audio-visual facilities became very popular because they provided both information and entertainment because the colour and sound engaged the viewers listeners and because it was easier for the general public to passively watch tv or listen to the radio than to actively read in recent times the internet become the latest and most popular mass medium information has become readily available through websites and easily accessible through search engines one can do many activities at the same time such as playing games listening to music and social networking irrespective of location whilst other forms of mass media are restricted in the type of information they can offer the internet comprises a large percentage of the sum of human knowledge through such things as google books modern day mass media includes the internet mobile phones blogs podcasts and rss feeds during the 20th century the growth of mass media was driven by technology including that which allowed much duplication of material physical duplication technologies such as printing record pressing and film duplication allowed the duplication of books newspapers and movies at low prices to huge audiences radio and television allowed the electronic duplication of information for the first time mass media had the economics of linear replication a single work could make money an example of riel and neils theory proportional to the number of copies sold and as volumes went up unit costs went down increasing profit margins further vast fortunes were to be made in mass media in a democratic society the media can serve the electorate about issues regarding government and corporate entities see media influence some consider the concentration of media ownership to be a threat to democracy mergers and acquisitions between 1985 and 2018 about 76,720 deals have been announced in the media industry this sums up to an overall value of around 5,634 bil usd there have been three major waves of m a in the mass media sector 2000 2007 and 2015 while the most active year in terms of numbers was 2007 with around 3,808 deals the u s is the most prominent country in media m a with 41 of the top 50 deals having an acquiror from the united states the largest deal in history was the acquisition of time warner by america online inc for 164,746.86 mil usd influence and sociology main article influence of mass media limited-effects theory originally tested in the 1940s and 1950s considers that because people usually choose what media to interact with based on what they already believe media exerts a negligible influence class-dominant theory argues that the media reflects and projects the view of a minority elite which controls it culturalist theory which was developed in the 1980s and 1990s combines the other two theories and claims that people interact with media to create their own meanings out of the images and messages they receive this theory states that audience members play an active rather than passive role in relation to mass media in an article entitled mass media influence on society rayuso argues that the media in the us is dominated by five major companies time warner viacom vivendi universal walt disney and news corp which own 95% of all mass media including theme parks movie studios television and radio broadcast networks and programing video news sports entertainment telecommunications wireless phones video games software electronic media and music companies whilst historically there was more diversity in companies they have recently merged to form an elite which have the power to shape the opinion and beliefs of people people buy after seeing thousands of advertisements by various companies in tv newspapers or magazines which are able to affect their purchasing decisions the definition of what is acceptable by society is dictated by the media this power can be used for good for example encouraging children to play sport however it can also be used for bad for example children being influenced by cigars smoked by film stars their exposure to sex images their exposure to images of violence and their exposure to junk food ads the documentary super size me describes how companies like mcdonalds have been sued in the past the plaintiffs claiming that it was the fault of their liminal and subliminal advertising that forced them to purchase the product the barbie and ken dolls of the 1950s are sometimes cited as the main cause for the obsession in modern-day society for women to be skinny and men to be buff after the attacks of 911 the media gave extensive coverage of the event and exposed osama bin ladens guilt for the attack information they were told by the authorities this shaped the public opinion to support the war on terrorism and later the war on iraq a main concern is that due to this immense power of the mass media being able to drive the public opinion media receiving inaccurate information could cause the public opinion to support the wrong cause in his book the commercialization of american culture matthew p mcallister says that a well-developed media system informing and teaching its citizens helps democracy move toward its ideal state in 1997 j r finnegan jr and k viswanath identified 3 main effects or functions of mass media the knowledge gap the mass media influences knowledge gaps due to factors including the extent to which the content is appealing the degree to which information channels are accessible and desirable and the amount of social conflict and diversity there is in a community agenda setting people are influence in how they think about issues due to the selective nature of what media choose for public consumption after publicly disclosing that he had prostate cancer prior to the 2000 new york senatorial election rudolph giuliani the mayor of new york city aided by the media sparked a huge priority elevation of the cancer in peoples consciousness this was because news media began to report on the risks of prostate cancer which in turn prompted a greater public awareness about the disease and the need for screening this ability for the media to be able to change how the public thinks and behaves has occurred on other occasions in mid-1970s when betty ford and happy rockefeller wives of the then-president and then-vice president respectively were both diagnosed with breast cancer j j davis states that when risks are highlighted in the media particularly in great detail the extent of agenda setting is likely to be based on the degree to which a public sense of outrage and threat is provoked when wanting to set an agenda framing can be invaluably useful to a mass media organisation framing involves taking a leadership role in the organisation of public discourse about an issue the media is influenced by the desire for balance in coverage and the resulting pressures can come from groups with particular political action and advocacy positions finnegan and viswanath say groups institutions and advocates compete to identify problems to move them onto the public agenda and to define the issues symbolically 1997 p 324 cultivation of perceptions the extent to which media exposure shapes audience perceptions over time is known as cultivation television is a common experience especially in places like the united states to the point where it can be described as a homogenising agent s w littlejohn however instead of being merely a result of the tv the effect is often based on socioeconomic factors having a prolonged exposure to tv or movie violence might affect a viewer to the extent where they actively think community violence is a problem or alternatively find it justifiable the resulting belief is likely to be different depending of where people live however since the 1950s when cinema radio and tv began to be the primary or the only source of information for a larger and larger percentage of the population these media began to be considered as central instruments of mass control up to the point that it emerged the idea that when a country has reached a high level of industrialization the country itself belongs to the person who controls communications mass media play a significant role in shaping public perceptions on a variety of important issues both through the information that is dispensed through them and through the interpretations they place upon this information they also play a large role in shaping modern culture by selecting and portraying a particular set of beliefs values and traditions an entire way of life as reality that is by portraying a certain interpretation of reality they shape reality to be more in line with that interpretation mass media also play a crucial role in the spread of civil unrest activities such as anti-government demonstrations riots and general strikes that is the use of radio and television receivers has made the unrest influence among cities not only by the geographic location of cities but also by proximity within the mass media distribution networks early minstrel shows lampooned the assumed stupidity of black people detail from cover of the celebrated negro melodies as sung by the virginia minstrels 1843 a magazine feature from beauty parade from march 1952 stereotyping women drivers it features bettie page as the model american political cartoon titled the usual irish way of doing things depicting a drunken irishman lighting a powder keg and swinging a bottle published in harpers weekly 1871 racism and stereotyping further information stereotype mass media sources through theories like framing and agenda-setting can affect the scope of a story as particular facts and information are highlighted media influence this can directly correlate with how individuals may perceive certain groups of people as the only media coverage a person receives can be very limited and may not reflect the whole story or situation stories are often covered to reflect a particular perspective to target a specific demographic example according to stephen balkaran an instructor of political science and african american studies at central connecticut state university mass media has played a large role in the way white americans perceive african-americans the media focus on african-american in the contexts of crime drug use gang violence and other forms of anti-social behavior has resulted in a distorted and harmful public perception of african-americans african-americans have been subjected to oppression and discrimination for the past few hundred years according to stephen balkaran in his article mass media and racism the media has played a key role in perpetuating the effects of this historical oppression and in contributing to african-americans continuing status as second-class citizens this has resulted in an uncertainty among white americans as to what the genuine nature of african-americans really is despite the resulting racial divide the fact that these people are undeniably american has raised doubts about the white mans value system this means that there is a somewhat troubling suspicion among some americans that their white america is tainted by the black influence mass media as well as propaganda tend to reinforce or introduce stereotypes to the general public ethical issues and criticism lack of local or specific topical focus is a common criticism of mass media a mass news media outlet is often forced to cover national and international news due to it having to cater for and be relevant for a wide demographic as such it has to skip over many interesting or important local stories because they simply do not interest the large majority of their viewers an example given by the website wisegeek is that the residents of a community might view their fight against development as critical but the story would only attract the attention of the mass media if the fight became controversial or if precedents of some form were set the term mass suggests that the recipients of media products constitute a vast sea of passive undifferentiated individuals this is an image associated with some earlier critiques of mass culture and mass society which generally assumed that the development of mass communication has had a largely negative impact on modern social life creating a kind of bland and homogeneous culture which entertains individuals without challenging them however interactive digital media have also been seen to challenge the read-only paradigm of earlier broadcast media whilst some refer to the mass media as opiate of the masses others argue that is a vital aspect of human societies by understanding mass media one is then able to analyse and find a deeper understanding of ones population and culture this valuable and powerful ability is one reason why the field of media studies is popular as wisegeek says watching reading and interacting with a nations mass media can provide clues into how people think especially if a diverse assortment of mass media sources are perused since the 1950s in the countries that have reached a high level of industrialization the mass media of cinema radio and tv have a key role in political power contemporary research demonstrates an increasing level of concentration of media ownership with many media industries already highly concentrated and dominated by a very small number of firms criticism when the study of mass media began the media was compiled of only mass media which is a very different media system than the social media empire of the 21st-century experiences with this in mind there are critiques that mass media no longer exists or at least that it doesnt exist in the same form as it once did this original form of mass media put filters on what the general public would be exposed to in regards to news something that is harder to do in a society of social media theorist lance

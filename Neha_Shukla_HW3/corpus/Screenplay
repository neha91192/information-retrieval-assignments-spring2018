screenplay or script is a written work by screenwriters for a film video game or television program these screenplays can be original works or adaptations from existing pieces of writing in them the movement actions expression and dialogues of the characters are also narrated a screenplay written for television is also known as a teleplay format and style edit the format is structured so that one page equates to roughly one minute of screen time though this is only used as a ballpark estimate and often bears little resemblance to the running time of the final movie the standard font is 12 point 10 pitch courier typeface the major components are action sometimes called screen direction and dialogue the action is written in the present tense and is limited to what can be heard or seen by the audience for example descriptions of settings character movements or sound effects the dialogue is the words the characters speak and is written in a center column unique to the screenplay as opposed to a stage play is the use of slug lines a slug line also called a master scene heading occurs at the start of every scene and typically contains three pieces of information whether the scene is set inside interior int or outside exterior ext the specific location and the time of day each slug line begins a new scene in a shooting script the slug lines are numbered consecutively for ease of reference physical format edit american screenplays are printed single-sided on three-hole-punched paper using the standard american letter size 8.5 x 11 inch they are then held together with two brass brads in the top and bottom hole the middle hole is left empty as it would otherwise make it harder to quickly read the script in the united kingdom double-hole-punched a4 paper is normally used which is slightly taller and narrower than us letter size some uk writers format the scripts for use in the us letter size especially when their scripts are to be read by american producers since the pages would otherwise be cropped when printed on us paper because each countrys standard paper size is difficult to obtain in the other country british writers often send an electronic copy to american producers or crop the a4 size to us letter a british script may be bound by a single brad at the top left hand side of the page making flicking through the paper easier during script meetings screenplays are usually bound with a light card stock cover and back page often showing the logo of the production company or agency submitting the script covers are there to protect the script during handling which can reduce the strength of the paper this is especially important if the script is likely to pass through the hands of several people or through the post increasingly reading copies of screenplays that is those distributed by producers and agencies in the hope of attracting finance or talent are distributed printed on both sides of the paper often professionally bound to reduce paper waste occasionally they are reduced to half-size to make a small book which is convenient to read or put in a pocket this is generally for use by the director or production crew during shooting although most writing contracts continue to stipulate physical delivery of three or more copies of a finished script it is common for scripts to be delivered electronically via email screenplay formats edit screenplays and teleplays use a set of standardizations beginning with proper formatting these rules are in part to serve the practical purpose of making scripts uniformly readable blueprints of movies and also to serve as a way of distinguishing a professional from an amateur feature film edit screenplay for the godfather part ii turin italy motion picture screenplays intended for submission to mainstream studios whether in the us or elsewhere in the world are expected to conform to a standard typographical style known widely as studio format which stipulates how elements of the screenplay such as scene headings action transitions dialog character names shots and parenthetical matter should be presented on the page as well as the font size and line spacing one reason for this is that when rendered in studio format most screenplays will transfer onto the screen at the rate of approximately one page per minute this rule of thumb is widely contested a page of dialogue usually occupies less screen time than a page of action for example and it depends enormously on the literary style of the writer and yet it continues to hold sway in modern hollywood there is no single standard for studio format some studios have definitions of the required format written into the rubric of their writers contract the nicholl fellowship a screenwriting competition run under the auspices of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences has a guide to screenplay format a more detailed reference is the complete guide to standard script formats screenplays are almost always written using a monospaced font often a variant of courier or courier new both mostly used as 12 pt font this is preferred due to its clarity screenplays are usually 90 120 pages long spec screenplay edit a spec script or speculative screenplay is a script written to be sold on the open market with no upfront payment or promise of payment the content is usually invented solely by the screenwriter though spec screenplays can also be based on established works or real people and events television edit for american tv shows the format rules for hour-long dramas like csi and single-camera sitcoms like scrubs are essentially the same as for motion pictures the main difference is that tv scripts have act breaks multi-camera sitcoms like i love lucy use a different specialized format that derives from radio and the stage play in this format dialogue is double-spaced action lines are capitalized and scene headings character entrances and exits and sound effects are capitalized and underlined drama series and sitcoms are no longer the only formats that require the skills of a writer with reality-based programming crossing genres to create various hybrid programs many of the so-called reality programs are in a large part scripted in format that is the overall skeleton of the show and its episodes are written to dictate the content and direction of the program the writers guild of america has identified this as a legitimate writers medium so much so that they have lobbied to impose jurisdiction over writers and producers who format reality-based productions creating reality show formats involves storytelling structure similar to screenwriting but much more condensed and boiled down to specific plot points or actions related to the overall concept and story documentaries edit the script format for documentaries and audio-visual presentations which consist largely of voice-over matched to still or moving pictures is different again and uses a two-column format which can be particularly difficult to achieve in standard word processors at least when it comes to editing or rewriting many script-editing software programs include templates for documentary formats screenwriting software edit main article screenwriting software various screenwriting software packages are available to help screenwriters adhere to the strict

filmmaking term for the analysis and grading of screenplays often within the script development department of a production company while coverage may remain entirely verbal it usually takes the form of a written report guided by a rubric that varies from company to company the original idea behind coverage was that a producers assistant could read a script and then give their producer a breakdown of the project and suggest whether they should consider producing the screenplay or not

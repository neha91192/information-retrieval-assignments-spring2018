nation also in the early 1900s motion picture production companies from new york and new jersey started moving to california because of the good weather and longer days although electric lights existed at that time none were powerful enough to adequately expose film the best source of illumination for movie production was natural sunlight besides the moderate dry climate they were also drawn to the state because of its open spaces and wide variety of natural scenery another reason was the distance of southern california from new jersey making it more difficult for thomas edison to enforce his motion picture patents at the time edison owned almost all the patents relevant to motion picture production and in the east movie producers acting independently of edisons motion picture patents company were often sued or enjoined by edison and his agents thus movie makers working on the west coast could work independently of edisons control if he sent agents to california word would usually

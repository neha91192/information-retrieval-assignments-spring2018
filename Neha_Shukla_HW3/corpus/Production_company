operating as virtual production-only movie studios notable examples include legendary studio metro-goldwyn-mayer which after many years of box office flops mostly with low budgets bad management and distribution and bankruptcy was restructured at the end of 2010 under new management and currently struck deals with some of the big six studios most notably the sony pictures motion picture group and warner bros miramax which was downsized by former owner disney into a smaller division after the weinstein brothers 2005 divestment and after 17 years under disney ownership was sold to a group of investors at the end of 2010 who eventually struck deals to co-finance the studios projects with other independent companies and dreamworks pictures the independently-run live action studio which currently releases many projects through universal pictures and formerly released their projects through disney after spinning off from paramount pictures which purchased the studio in 2006 and stripped it of its independent distributor status in 2008 staffing funds and equipment edit because a production company is only operational when a production is being produced and most of the talent and crew are freelancers many production companies are only required to hire management staff that helps to oversee the companys daily activities in some cases a production company can be run by only a handful of people the companys funds are mainly committed towards employing talent crew and acquiring new updated production equipment on a regular basis many productions often require at least one to two cameras and lighting equipment for on location shooting production equipment is either leased or purchased from another production company or directly from the manufacturer in the entertainment industry in order to secure experienced professional talent and crew production companies often become a signatory company to that talent or crew members guild by becoming a signatory company it agrees to abide by the guild regulations all big budget guild productions are exclusive to guild members and non guild members are not allowed to participate in these productions unless authorized by

production or media broadcast in entertainment the production process begins with the development of a specific project once a final script has been produced by the screenwriters the production enters into the pre-production phase most productions never reach this phase for financing or talent reasons in pre-production the actors are signed on and prepared for their roles crew is signed on shooting locations are found sets are built or acquired and the proper shooting permits are acquired for on location shooting actors and crew are hand picked by the producer director and casting director who often use collaborators or referenced personnel to prevent untrusted or unwelcomed people from gaining access to a specific production and compromising the entire production through leaks once a production enters into principal photography it begins filming productions are almost never cancelled once they reach this phase codenames are often used on bigger productions during filming to conceal the productions shooting locations for both privacy and safety reasons in many cases the director producers and the leading actors are often the only people with access to a full or majority of a single script supporting actors background actors and crew often never receive a full copy of a specific script to prevent leaks productions are often shot in secured studios with limited to no public access but they are also shot on location on secured sets or locations due to the exposure when shooting in public locations major productions often employ security to ensure the protection of the talent and crew working on a specific production after filming is completed the production enters into post production which is handled by a post production company and overseen by the production company the editing musical score visual effects re-recording of the dialog and sound effects are mixed to create the final film which is then screened at the final screening marketing is also launched during this phase such as the release of trailers and posters once a final film has been approved the film is taken over by the distributors who then release the film other details edit for legal reasons it is common within the entertainment industry for production companies not to accept unsolicited materials from any other company talent or the general public it is also common for filmmakers or producers to become entrepreneurs and open their own production companies so that they can have more control over their careers and pay while acting as an in-house creative and business

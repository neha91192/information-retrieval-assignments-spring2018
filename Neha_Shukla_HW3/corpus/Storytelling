elements of stories and storytelling include plot characters and narrative point of view the term storytelling can refer in a narrow sense specifically to oral storytelling and also in a looser sense to techniques used in other media to unfold or disclose the narrative of a story historical perspective edit a very fine par dated 1938 a d the epic of pabuji is an oral epic in the rajasthani language that tells of the deeds of the folk hero-deity pabuji who lived in the 14th century storytelling predates writing the earliest forms of storytelling were usually oral combined with gestures and expressions in addition to being part of religious rituals some archaeologists believe rock art may have served as a form of storytelling for many ancient cultures the australian aboriginal people painted symbols from stories on cave walls as a means of helping the storyteller remember the story the story was then told using a combination of oral narrative music rock art and dance which bring understanding and meaning of human existence through remembrance and enactment of stories people have used the carved trunks of living trees and ephemeral media such as sand and leaves to record stories in pictures or with writing complex forms of tattooing may also represent stories with information about genealogy affiliation and social status with the advent of writing and the use of stable portable media stories were recorded transcribed and shared over wide regions of the world stories have been carved scratched painted printed or inked onto wood or bamboo ivory and other bones pottery clay tablets stone palm-leaf books skins parchment bark cloth paper silk canvas and other textiles recorded on film and stored electronically in digital form oral stories continue to be created improvisationally by impromptu storytellers as well as committed to memory and passed from generation to generation despite the increasing popularity of written and televised media in much of the world contemporary storytelling edit modern storytelling has a broad purview in addition to its traditional forms fairytales folktales mythology legends fables etc it has extended itself to representing history personal narrative political commentary and evolving cultural norms contemporary storytelling is also widely used to address educational objectives new forms of media are creating new ways for people to record express and consume stories tools for asynchronous group communication can provide an environment for individuals to reframe or recast individual stories into group stories games and other digital platforms such as those used in interactive fiction or interactive storytelling may be used to position the user as a character within a bigger world documentaries including interactive web documentaries employ storytelling narrative techniques to communicate information about their topic self-revelatory stories created for their cathartic and therapeutic effect are growing in their use and application as in psychodrama drama therapy and playback theatre oral traditions edit see also oral storytelling an african storyteller in parc des buttes chaumont paris france oral traditions of storytelling are found in several civilisations they predate the printed and online press storytelling was used to explain natural phenomena bards told stories of creation and developed a pantheon of gods and myths oral stories passed from one generation to the next and storytellers were regarded as healers leader spiritual guides teachers cutural secret keeper and entertainers oral storytelling came in various forms including songs poetry chants and dance albert bates lord examined oral narratives from field transcripts of yugoslav oral bards collected by milman parry in the 1930s and the texts of epics such as the odyssey and beowulf lord found that a large part of the stories consisted of text which was improvised during the telling process lord identified two types of story vocabulary the first he called formulas rosy-fingered dawn the wine-dark sea and other specific set phrases had long been known of in homer and other oral epics lord however discovered that across many story traditions fully 90% of an oral epic is assembled from lines which are repeated verbatim or which use one-for-one word substitutions in other words oral stories are built out of set phrases which have been stockpiled from a lifetime of hearing and telling stories the other type of story vocabulary is theme a set sequence of story actions that structure a tale just as the teller of tales proceeds line-by-line using formulas so he proceeds from event-to-event using themes one near-universal theme is repetition as evidenced in western folklore with the rule of three three brothers set out three attempts are made three riddles are asked a theme can be as simple as a specific set sequence describing the arming of a hero starting with shirt and trousers and ending with headdress and weapons a theme can be large enough to be a plot component for example a hero proposes a journey to a dangerous place he disguises himself his disguise fools everybody except for a common person of little account a crone a tavern maid or a woodcutter who immediately recognizes him the commoner becomes the heros ally showing unexpected resources of skill or initiative a theme does not belong to a specific story but may be found with minor variation in many different stories themes may be no more than handy prefabricated parts for constructing a tale or they may represent universal truths ritual-based religious truths as james frazer saw in the golden bough or archetypal psychological truths as joseph campbell describes in the hero with a thousand faces the story was described by reynolds price when he wrote a need to tell and hear stories is essential to the species homo sapiens second in necessity apparently after nourishment and before love and shelter millions survive without love or home almost none in silence the opposite of silence leads quickly to narrative and the sound of story is the dominant sound of our lives from the small accounts of our days events to the vast incommunicable constructs of psychopaths märchen and sagen edit illustration from silesian folk tales the book of rubezahl folklorists sometimes divide oral tales into two main groups märchen and sagen these are german terms for which there are no exact english equivalents however we have approximations märchen loosely translated as fairy tale s lit little stories take place in a kind of separate once-upon-a-time world of nowhere-in-particular at an indeterminate time in the past they are clearly not intended to be understood as true the stories are full of clearly defined incidents and peopled by rather flat characters with little or no interior life when the supernatural occurs it is presented matter-of-factly without surprise indeed there is very little effect generally bloodcurdling events may take place but with little call for emotional response from the listener sagen best translated as legends are supposed to have actually happened very often at a particular time and place and they draw much of their power from this fact when the supernatural intrudes as it often does it does so in an emotionally fraught manner ghost and lovers leap stories belong in this category as do many ufo stories and stories of supernatural beings and events another important examination of orality in human life is walter j ong s orality and literacy the technologizing of the word 1982 ong studies the distinguishing characteristics of oral traditions how oral and written cultures interact and condition one another and how they ultimately influence human epistemology storytelling and learning edit orunamamu storyteller griot with cane storytelling is a means for sharing and interpreting experiences peter l berger says human life is narratively rooted humans construct their lives and shape their world into homes in terms of these groundings and memories stories are universal in that they can bridge cultural linguistic and age-related divides storytelling can be adaptive for all ages leaving out the notion of age segregation storytelling can be used as a method to teach ethics values and cultural norms and differences learning is most effective when it takes place in social environments that provide authentic social cues about how knowledge is to be applied stories function as a tool to pass on knowledge in a social context so every story has 3 parts first the setup the heros world before the adventure starts second the confrontation the heros world turned upside down third the resolution hero conquers villain but its not enough for hero to survive the hero or world must be transformed any story can be framed in such format human knowledge is based on stories and the human brain consists of cognitive machinery necessary to understand remember and tell stories humans are storytelling organisms that both individually and socially lead storied lives stories mirror human thought as humans think in narrative structures and most often remember facts in story form facts can be understood as smaller versions of a larger story thus storytelling can supplement analytical thinking because storytelling requires auditory and visual senses from listeners one can learn to organize their mental representation of a story recognize structure of language and express his or her thoughts stories tend to be based on experiential learning but learning from an experience is not automatic often a person needs to attempt to tell the story of that experience before realizing its value in this case it is not only the listener who learns but the teller who also becomes aware of his or her own unique experiences and background this process of storytelling is empowering as the teller effectively conveys ideas and with practice is able to demonstrate the potential of human accomplishment storytelling taps into existing knowledge and creates bridges both culturally and motivationally toward a solution stories are effective educational tools because listeners become engaged and therefore remember storytelling can be seen as a foundation for learning and teaching while the storylistener is engaged they are able to imagine new perspectives inviting a transformative and empathetic experience this involves allowing the individual to actively engage in the story as well as observe listen and participate with minimal guidance listening to a storyteller can create lasting personal connections promote innovative problem solving and foster a shared understanding regarding future ambitions the listener can then activate knowledge and imagine new possibilities together a storyteller and listener can seek best practices and invent new solutions because stories often have multiple layers of meanings listeners have to listen closely to identify the underlying knowledge in the story storytelling is used as a tool to teach children the importance of respect through the practice of listening as well as connecting children with their environment through the theme of the stories and give them more autonomy by using repetitive statements which improve their learning to learn competence it is also used to teach children to have respect for all life value inter-connectedness and always work to overcome adversity to teach this a kinesthetic learningstyle would be used involving the listeners through music dream interpretation or dance storytelling in indigenous cultures edit the historian the indian artist is painting in sign language on buckskin the story of a battle with american soldiers for indigenous cultures of the americas storytelling is used as an oral form of language associated with practices and values essential to developing ones identity this is because everyone in the community can add their own touch and perspective to the narrative collaboratively both individual and culturally shared perspectives have a place in the co-creation of the story oral storytelling in indigenous communities differs from other forms of stories because they are told not only for entertainment but for teaching values for example the sto lo community in canada focuses on reinforcing childrens identity by telling stories about the land to explain their roles furthermore storytelling is a way to teach younger members of indigenous communities about their culture and their identities in donna eders study navajos were interviewed about storytelling practices that they have had in the past and what changes they want to see in the future they notice that storytelling makes an impact on the lives of the children of the navajos according to some of the navajos that were interviewed storytelling is one of many main practices that teaches children the important principles to live a good life in indigenous communities stories are a way to pass knowledge on from generation to generation for some indigenous people experience has no separation between the physical world and the spiritual world thus some indigenous people communicate to their children through ritual storytelling or dialogue community values learned through storytelling help to guide future generations and aid in identity formation in the quechua community of highland peru there is no separation between adults and children this allows for children to learn storytelling through their own interpretations of the given story therefore children in the quechua community are encouraged to listen to the story that is being told in order to learn about their identity and culture sometimes children are expected to sit quietly and listen actively this enables them to engage in activities as independent learners this teaching practice of storytelling allowed children to formulate ideas based on their own experiences and perspectives in navajo communities for children and adults storytelling is one of the many effective ways to educate both the young and old about their cultures identities and history storytelling help the navajos know who they are where they come from and where they belong storytelling in indigenous cultures is sometimes passed on by oral means in a quiet and relaxing environment which usually coincides with family or tribal community gatherings and official events such as family occasions rituals or ceremonial practices during the telling of the story children may act as participants by asking questions acting out the story or telling smaller parts of the story furthermore stories are not often told in the same manner twice resulting in many variations of a single myth this is because narrators may choose to insert new elements into old stories dependent upon the relationship between the storyteller and the audience making the story correspond to each unique situation indigenous cultures also use instructional ribbing a playful form of correcting childrens undesirable behavior— in their stories for example the ojibwe or chippewa tribe uses the tale of an owl snatching away misbehaving children the caregiver will often say the owl will come and stick you in his ears if you dont stop crying thus this form of teasing serves as a tool to correct inappropriate behavior and promote cooperation types of storytelling in indigenous peoples edit there are various types of stories among many indigenous communities communication in indigenous american communities is rich with stories myths philosophies and narratives that serve as a means to exchange information these stories may be used for coming of age themes core values morality literacy and history very often the stories are used to instruct and teach children about cultural values and lessons the meaning within the stories is not always explicit and children are expected to make their own meaning of the stories in the lakota tribe of north america for example young girls are often told the story of the white buffalo calf woman who is a spiritual figure that protects young girls from the whims of men in the odawa tribe young boys are often told the story of a young man who never took care of his body and as a result his feet fail to run when he tries to escape predators this story serves as an indirect means of encouraging the young boys to take care of their bodies narratives can be shared to express the values or morals among family relatives or people who are considered part of the close-knit community many stories in indigenous american communities all have a surface story that entails knowing certain information and clues to unlocking the metaphors in the story the underlying message of the story being told can be understood and interpreted with clues that hint to a certain interpretation in order to make meaning from these stories elders in the sto lo community for example emphasize the importance in learning how to listen since it requires the senses to bring ones heart and mind together for instance a way in which children learn about the metaphors significant for the society they live in is by listening to their elders and participating in rituals where they respect one another some people also make a case for different narrative forms being classified as storytelling in the contemporary world for example digital storytelling online and dice-and-paper-based role-playing games in traditional role-playing games storytelling is done by the person who controls the environment and the non playing fictional characters and moves the story elements along for the players as they interact with the storyteller the game is advanced by mainly verbal interactions with dice roll determining random events in the fictional universe where the players interact with each other and the storyteller this type of game has many genres such as sci-fi and fantasy as well as alternate-reality worlds based on the current reality but with different setting and beings such as werewolves aliens daemons or hidden societies these oral-based role-playing games were very popular in the 1990s among circles of youth in many countries before computer and console-based online mmorpgs took their place despite the prevalence of computer-based mmorpgs the dice-and-paper rpg still has a dedicated following passing on of values in indigenous cultures edit stories in indigenous cultures encompass a variety of values these values include an emphasis on individual responsibility concern for the environment and communal welfare stories are based on values passed down by older generations to shape the foundation of the community storytelling is used as a bridge for knowledge and understanding allowing the values of self and community to connect and be learned as a whole storytelling in the navajo community for example allows for community values to be learned at different times and places for different learners stories are told from the perspective of other people animals or the natural elements of the earth in this way children learn to value their place in the world as a person in relation to others typically stories are used as an informal learning tool in indigenous american communities and can act as an alternative method for reprimanding childrens bad behavior in this way stories are non-confrontational which allows the child to discover for themselves what they did wrong and what they can do to adjust the behavior parents in the arizona tewa community for example teach morals to their children through traditional narratives lessons focus on several topics including historical or sacred stories or more domestic disputes through storytelling the tewa community emphasizes the traditional wisdom of the ancestors and the importance of collective as well as individual identities indigenous communities teach children valuable skills and morals through the actions of good or mischievous stock characters while also allowing room for children to make meaning for themselves by not being given every element of the story children rely on their own experiences and not formal teaching from adults to fill in the gaps when children listen to stories they periodically vocalize their ongoing attention and accept the extended turn of the storyteller the emphasis on attentiveness to surrounding events and the importance of oral tradition in indigenous communities teaches children the skill of keen attention for example children of the tohono oodham american indian community who engaged in more cultural practices were able to recall the events in a verbally presented story better than those who did not engage in cultural practices body movements and gestures help to communicate values and keep stories alive for future generations elders parents and grandparents are typically involved in teaching the children the cultural ways along with history community values and teachings of the land children in indigenous communities can also learn from the underlying message of a story for example in a nahuatl community near mexico city stories about ahuaques or hostile water dwelling spirits that guard over the bodies of water contain morals about respecting the environment if the protagonist of a story who has accidentally broken something that belongs to the ahuaque does not replace it or give back in some way to the ahuaque the protagonist dies in this way storytelling serves as a way to teach what the community values such as valuing the environment storytelling also serves to deliver a particular message during spiritual and ceremonial functions in the ceremonial use of storytelling the unity building theme of the message becomes more important than the time place and characters of the message once the message is delivered the story is finished as cycles of the tale are told and retold story units can recombine showing various outcomes for a persons actions storytelling research edit storytelling has been assessed for critical literacy skills and the learning of theatre-related terms by the nationally recognized storytelling and creative drama organization neighborhood bridges in minneapolis another storyteller researcher in the uk proposes that the social space created preceding oral storytelling in schools may trigger sharing parfitt 2014 storytelling has also been studied as a way to investigate and archive cultural knowledge and values within indigenous american communities isekes study 2013 on the role of storytelling in the metis community showed promise in furthering research about the metis and their shared communal atmosphere during storytelling events iseke focused on the idea of witnessing a storyteller as a vital way to share and partake in the metis community as members of the community would stop everything else they were doing in order to listen or witness the storyteller and allow the story to become a ceremonial landscape or shared reference for everyone present this was a powerful tool for the community to engage and teach new learner shared references for the values and ideologies of the metis through storytelling the metis cemented the shared reference of personal or popular stories and folklore which members of the community can use to share ideologies in the future iseke noted that metis elders wished for the stories being told to be used for further research into their culture as stories were a traditional way to pass down vital knowledge to younger generations for the stories we read the neuro-semantic encoding of narratives happens at levels higher than individual semantic units and that this encoding is systematic across both individuals and languages this encoding seems to appear most prominently in the default mode network storytelling as a political praxis edit some approaches treat narratives as politically motivated stories stories empowering certain groups and stories giving people agency instead of just searching for the main point of the narrative the political function is demanded through asking whose interest does a personal narrative serve this approach mainly looks at the power authority knowledge ideology and identity whether it legitimates and dominates or resists and empowers all personal narratives are seen as ideological because they evolve from a structure of power relations and simultaneously produce maintain and reproduce that power structure political theorist hannah arendt argues that storytelling transforms private meaning to public meaning regardless of the gender of the narrator and what story they are sharing the performance of the narrative and the audience listening to it is where the power lies therapeutic storytelling edit therapeutic storytelling is the act of telling ones story in an attempt to better understand oneself or ones situation oftentimes these stories affect the audience in a therapeutic sense as well helping them to view situations similar to their own through a different lens noted author and folklore scholar elaine lawless states this process provides new avenues for understanding and identity formation language is utilised to bear witness to their lives sometimes a narrator will simply skip over certain details without realising only to include it in their stories during a later telling in this way that telling and retelling of the narrative serves to reattach portions of the narrative these gaps may occur due to a repression of the trauma or even just a want to keep the most gruesome details private regardless these silences are not as empty as they appear and it is only this act of storytelling that can enable the teller to fill them back in psychodrama uses re-enactment of a personal traumatic event in the life of a psychodrama group participant as a therapeutic methodology first developed by psychiatrist j l moreno m d this therapeutic use of storytelling was incorporated into drama therapy known in the field as self revalatory theater in 1975 jonathan fox and jo salas developed a therapeutic improvisational storytelling form they called playback theatre storytelling as art form edit aesthetics edit the art of narrative is by definition an aesthetic enterprise and there are a number of artistic elements that typically interact in well-developed stories such elements include the essential idea of narrative structure with identifiable beginnings middles and endings or exposition-development-climax-resolution-denouement normally constructed into coherent plot lines a strong focus on temporality which includes retention of the past attention to present action and protention future anticipation a substantial focus on characters and characterization which is arguably the most important single component of the novel a given heterogloss of different voices dialogically at play the sound of the human voice or many voices speaking in a variety of accents rhythms and registers possesses a narrator or narrator-like voice which by definition addresses and interacts with reading audiences see reader response theory communicates with a wayne booth -esque rhetorical thrust a dialectic process of interpretation which is at times beneath the surface conditioning a plotted narrative and at other times much more visible arguing for and against various positions relies substantially on now-standard aesthetic figuration particularly including the use of metaphor metonymy synecdoche and irony see hayden white metahistory for expansion of this idea is often enmeshed in intertextuality with copious connections references allusions similarities parallels etc to other literatures and commonly demonstrates an effort toward bildungsroman a description of identity development with an effort to evince becoming in character and community festivals edit storytelling festivals feature the work of several storytellers elements of the oral storytelling art form include visualization the seeing of images in the minds eye and vocal and bodily gestures in many ways the art of storytelling draws upon other art forms such as acting oral interpretation and performance studies several storytelling organizations started in the u s during the 1970s one such organization was the national association for the perpetuation and preservation of storytelling napps now the national storytelling network nsn and the international storytelling center isc nsn is a professional organization that helps to organize resources for tellers and festival planners the isc runs the national storytelling festival in jonesborough tn australia followed their american counterparts with the establishment of storytelling guilds in the late 1970s australian storytelling today has individuals and groups across the country who meet to share their stories the uks society for storytelling was founded in 1993 bringing together tellers and listeners and each year since 2000 has run a national storytelling week the first week of february currently there are dozens of storytelling festivals and hundreds of professional storytellers around the world and an international celebration of the art occurs on world storytelling day emancipation of the story edit in oral traditions stories are kept alive by being told again and again the material of any given story naturally undergoes several changes and adaptations during this process when and where oral tradition was pushed back in favor of print media the literary idea of the author as originator of a storys authoritative version changed peoples perception of stories themselves in centuries following stories tended to be seen as the work of individuals rather than a collective effort only recently when a significant number of influential authors began questioning their own roles the value of stories as such independent of authorship was again recognized literary critics such as roland barthes even proclaimed the death of the author in business edit within the workplace edit storytelling practice example summer school berlin school of economics 2013 european business and economics ebep for many multi-media communication complex institutions communicating by using storytelling techniques can be a more compelling and effective route of delivering information than that of using only dry facts uses include using narrative to manage conflicts for managers storytelling is an important way of resolving conflicts addressing issues and facing challenges managers may use narrative discourse to deal with conflicts when direct action is inadvisable or impossible using narrative to interpret the past and shape the future in a group discussion a process of collective narration can help to influence others and unify the group by linking the past to the future in such discussions managers transform problems requests and issues into stories jameson calls this collective group construction storybuilding using narrative in the reasoning process storytelling plays an important role in reasoning processes and in convincing others in meetings the managers preferred stories to abstract arguments or statistical measures when situations are complex narrative allows the managers to involve more context in marketing edit storytelling is increasingly used in advertising today in order to build customer loyalty according to giles lury this marketing trend echoes the deeply rooted need of all humans to be entertained stories are illustrative easily memorable and allow any firm to create stronger emotional bonds with the customers a nielsen study shows consumers want a more personal connection in the way they gather information our brains are far more engaged by storytelling than by cold hard facts when reading straight data only the language parts of our brains work to decode the meaning but when we read a story not only do the language parts of our brains light up but any other part of the brain that we would use if we were actually experiencing what were reading about becomes activated as well this means its far easier for us to remember stories than hard facts developments include the use of trans-media techniques originating in the film industry which build a world in which your story can evolve examples include coca-cola s happiness factory

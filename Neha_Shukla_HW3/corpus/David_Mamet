distinctive that it has come to be called mamet speak mamet has recognized an association of his edgy narrative style by noting his debt to harold pinter to whom he dedicated glengarry glen ross he often uses italics and quotation marks to highlight particular words and to draw attention to his characters frequent manipulation and deceitful use of language his characters frequently interrupt one another their sentences trail off unfinished and their dialogue overlaps moreover certain expressions and figures of speech are deliberately misrepresented to show that the character is not paying close attention to every detail of his dialogue e g or so forth instead of and so forth mamet himself has criticized his and other writers tendency to write pretty at the expense of sound logical plots when asked how he developed his style for writing dialogue mamet said in my family in the days prior to television we liked to while away the evenings by making ourselves miserable based solely on our ability to speak the language viciously thats probably where my ability was honed one instance of mamets dialogue style can be found in glengarry glen ross in which two down-on-their-luck real estate salesmen are considering stealing from their employers office george aaronow and dave moss equivocate on the meaning of talk and speak turning language and meaning to deceptive purposes moss no what do you mean have i talked to him about this pause aaronow yes i mean are you actually talking about this or are we just moss no were just aaronow were just talking about it moss were just speaking about it pause as an idea aaronow as an idea moss yes aaronow were not actually talking about it moss no aaronow talking about it as a moss no aaronow as a robbery moss as a robbery no mamet

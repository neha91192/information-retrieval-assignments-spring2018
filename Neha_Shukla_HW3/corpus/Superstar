early 1900s development of the hollywood star system edit main article star system filmmaking by 1909 the silent film companies began promoting picture personalities by releasing stories about these actors to fan magazines and newspapers as part of a strategy to build brand loyalty for their companys actors and films by the 1920s hollywood film company promoters had developed a massive industrial enterprise that peddled a new intangible—fame hollywood image makers and promotional agents planted rumours selectively released real or fictitious biographical information to the press and used other gimmicks to create personas for actors then they worked to reinforce that persona and manage the publicity publicists thus created the enduring images and public perceptions of screen legends such as rock hudson marilyn monroe and grace kelly the development of this star system made fame something that could be fabricated purposely by the masters of the new machinery of glory 1970s academic interest in stardom edit the undertaker the longest tenured and one of the most famous wwe superstars according to sofia johansson the canonical texts on stardom include articles by boorstin 1971 alberoni 1972 and dyer 1979 that examined the representations of stars and on aspects of the hollywood star system johansson notes that more recent analyses within media and cultural studies e g gamson 1994 marshall 1997 giles 2000 turner marshall and bonner 2000 rojek 2001 turner 2004 have instead dealt with the idea of a pervasive contemporary celebrity culture in the analysis of the celebrity culture fame and its constituencies are conceived of as a broader social process connected to widespread economic political technological and cultural developments in 1976 mattel inc produced a superstar concept of its barbie™ doll 1980s–1990s publicity tactics edit in the 1980s and 1990s entertainment publicity tactics have become more subtle and sophisticated such as using press releases movie junkets and community activities these promotional efforts are targeted and designed using market research to increase the predictability of success of their media ventures in some cases publicity agents may create provocative advertisements or make an outrageous public statement to trigger public controversy and thereby generate free news coverage socio-psychological theories edit katy perry part of me movie premiere in sydney australia she is an american singer and the latest superstar some of her music videos have been viewed over a billion times on youtube according to roger caillois superstars are created by the interplay between mass media free enterprise and competition superstars are produced by a mixture of effort by the actors or athletes and chance the luck of winning due to the many arbitrary factors influencing sports film releases etc the superstar has extraordinary natural talent augmented by an even more extraordinary perseverance and drive musician park jae-sang stage name psy of south korea was referred to as globalstar one of his videos was viewed over 2.2 billion times on youtube the highest views recorded in youtubes history however small and relative differences are of decisive importance for winning or losing by a hairs breadth it is here that chance plays a role a sudden gust of wind at the end of a yachting race can mean the difference between stardom and defeat caillois notes that the role of chance in superstardom is paradoxical given that the west is such a predominantly meritocratic society which valorizes the role of work competition activity and determination since only one may be first a person may choose to win indirectly through identification with someone else - the superstar whose triumph as the most popular actor or hit recording artist is in part due to the actions of those who worship the hero the public believes that the manicurist elected beauty queen by the sales girl entrusted with the heroines role in a super production by the shopkeepers daughter winning the tour de france and by the gas station attendant who basks in the limelight as a champion toreador represents the chance or possibility from the publics perspective that they may become wealthy and successful for example levine points out that lars ulrich the drummer for metallica was a service station attendant before becoming a rich rock star harrison ford was a cabinet maker before becoming a wealthy film star caillois calls superstars huge incomes and rewards disguised lotteries a special kind of game of chance for example the grand prizes for literary competitions bring fortune and glory to a writer for several years caillois notes that a superstar cannot merely be successful at some activity they must also be richly rewarded he says that the material reward of the superstar is a necessary ingredient for the glory of the star for the identification of the public with the star or whether it is the excellence or the private life of the star which is of more importance he states that superstars extravagant incomes play an important psychological compensating mechanism role for the public according to madow fame is a relational phenomenon something that is conferred by others a person can within the limits of his natural talents make himself strong or swift or learned but he cannot in this same sense make himself famous any more than he can make himself loved madow goes on to point out that fame is often conferred or withheld just as love is for reasons and on grounds other than merit this means that regardless of how strenuously the star may try to monitor and shape it the media and the public always play a substantial part in the image-making process economics of superstars edit jackie chan at the 2008 cannes film festival he is one of the most well known chinese people in the world sherwin rosen 1981 examined the economics of superstars to determine why relatively small numbers of people earn enormous amounts of money and seem to dominate the fields in which they engage rosen argues that in superstar markets small differences in talent at the top of the distribution will translate into large differences in revenue rosen points out that sellers of higher talent charge only slightly higher prices than those of lower talent but sell much larger quantities their greater earnings come overwhelmingly from selling larger quantities than from charging higher prices modern microconomist alfred marshall explains that technology has greatly extended the power and reach of the planets most gifted performers he referenced a classical of the british opera singer elizabeth billington she was a well-acclaimed soprano with a strong voice that naturally did not have access to a microphone or amplifier in 1798 let alone to mtv cds itunes and pandora she could only reach a small audience this limited her ability to dominate the market in the way that artists to do today marshall wrote so long as the number of persons who can be reached by a human voice is strictly limited it is not very likely that any singer will make an advance on the 10,000 said to have been earned in a season by mrs billington at the beginning of the last century nearly as great an increase as that which the business leaders of the present generation have made on those of the last furthermore the trends in popular music indicate that the price of the average concert ticket increased by nearly 400% from 1981 to 2012 much faster than the 150% rise in overall consumer price inflation debate over superstardom edit some scholars argue that superstardom has a useful role in society caillois cites rawls who states that the premiums earned by scarce natural talents serve to cover the costs of training and to encourage the efforts of learning as well as to direct ability to where it best furthers the common interest cowen 2000 cites rosen 1981 to argue that the superstars effect is welfare-improving consumers get better performances even if it leads to raising income inequality and adds that the superstar phenomenon should not be overstressed indeed fame is a positive-sum game not a negative nor a zero-sum one cowen states that countervailing forces operate such as a convergence of quality that limits the ability of the very best stars to dominate the market for long or more radically the elastic supply of fame this means that when demand for fame increases the numbers of prizes rewards and whatever fame generating distinctions is rising too on the other hand it has been argued compensation systems that resemble prizes lotteries can also create perverse incentives by discouraging cooperative behaviour and may encourage some contestants to disrupt the performance of competitors as well frank and cook 1995 have called into question the way the winner-take-all markets operate with their damaging features they argue that the winner-take-all payoff structure of competition for superstardom generates a spiral of individual and social occupational waste since it leads both to increasing monetary and non-monetary reward inequalities and to overcrowdings in the markets and occupations prone to an overestimation of ones chance to succeed thus as a result they argue that when excess numbers of contestants are induced to invest in performance enhancement in order to raise their individual odds of winning these investments will be mutually offsetting and socially inefficient end consumers may get more valuable products but the social costs are excessive other meanings edit superstar art museums edit a small number of major art museums including frank lloyd wrights guggenheim museum in new york the centre pompidou in paris frank gehrys guggenheim museum in bilbao among others have become household names and major tourist destinations art museums such as these with their striking architecturally designed buildings and very well known masterpieces can be termed superstar art museums with their huge visitor traffic superstar museums are often able to derive a significant income from museum bookshops and restaurants and have a major impact on the local economy superstar museums are able to use the popular appeal of their location and art holdings to produce their own books videos and television specials which adds an additional revenue stream and further reinforces the publics awareness of the museum some superstar museums have also begun establishing museum networks for example londons tate gallery has launched satellite art museums at liverpool and st ives cultural institutions such as art museums play a gatekeeping role for consumers helping to screen and grade the cultural artifacts and artworks thus reduc ing information and search costs for consumers moreover by channelling resources to a limited group of visual artists cultural institutions also enhance superstar phenomena within the visual arts superstar ceos edit mcgraw-hills economic website argues that the multimillion-dollar salaries of superstar chief executive officers ceos in the corporate world can be viewed as a type of tournament prize the huge salaries of superstar executives often seem to resemble prizes for the winners of contests rather than compensation in return for the value of the marginal product of labour as an example a company may have many vice-presidents of roughly comparable ability and the v-p who may only be slightly more talented than the others that is promoted to president receives a huge salary increase which resembles a prize for winning the contest as best v-p the article goes on to argue that such a compensation system may be efficient if the organization is only able to rank its executives according to the relative value of their contribution to the organization the organization cannot measure the productivity of each executive only the productivity of the group of executives moreover even if executives are paid a wage equal to the average productivity of the group there will still be an incentive to perform in order be promoted and win the prize however compensation systems that resemble prizes can also create perverse incentives by discouraging cooperative behaviour and may encourage some contestants to disrupt the performance of competitors

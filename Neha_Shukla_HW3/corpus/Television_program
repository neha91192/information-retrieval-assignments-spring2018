also called a television program british english programme a limited number of episodes of a television show may be called a miniseries or a serial or limited series a television series is without a fixed length and are usually divided into seasons u s and canada or series uk yearly or semiannual sets of new episodes while there is no defined length u s industry practice has traditionally favored longer television seasons than those of other countries a one-time broadcast may be called a special or particularly in the uk a special episode a television film made-for-tv movie or television movie is a film that is initially broadcast on television rather than released in theaters or direct-to-video a program can be either recorded as on video tape other various electronic media forms played with an on-demand player or viewed on live television formats edit television programs may be fictional as in comedies and dramas or non-fictional as in documentary news and reality television it may be topical as in the case of a local newscast and some made-for-television films or historical as in the case of many documentaries and fictional series they could be primarily instructional or educational or entertaining as is the case in situation comedy and game shows a drama program usually features a set of actors playing characters in a historical or contemporary setting the program follows their lives and adventures except for soap opera -type serials many shows especially before the 1980s remained static without story arcs and the main characters and premise changed little if some change happened to the characters lives during the episode it was usually undone by the end because of this the episodes could be broadcast in any order since the 1980s there are many series that feature progressive change to the plot the characters or both for instance hill street blues and st elsewhere were two of the first american prime time drama television series to have this kind of dramatic structure while the later series babylon 5 is an extreme example of such production that had a predetermined story running over its intended five-season run in 2012 it was reported that television was growing into a larger component of major media companies revenues than film some also noted the increase in quality of some television programs in 2012 academy-award-winning film director steven soderbergh commenting on ambiguity and complexity of character and narrative stated i think those qualities are now being seen on television and that people who want to see stories that have those kinds of qualities are watching television genres edit see also list of genres film and television formats and genres tv production scripted entertainment edit informational edit development edit united states edit when a person or company decides to create a new series they develop the shows elements consisting of the concept the characters the crew and cast then they often pitch it to the various networks in an attempt to find one interested enough to order a prototype first episode of the series known as a pilot eric coleman an animation executive at disney told an interviewer one misconception is that it s very difficult to get in and pitch your show when the truth is that development executives at networks want very much to hear ideas they want very much to get the word out on what types of shows they re looking for to create the pilot the structure and team of the whole series must be put together if the network likes the pilot they pick up the show to air it the next season usually fall sometimes they save it for mid-season or request rewrites and father review known in the industry as development hell other times they pass entirely forcing the shows creator to shop it around to other networks many shows never make it past the pilot stage the show hires a stable of writers who usually work in parallel the first writer works on the first episode the second on the second episode etc when all the writers have been used episode assignment starts again with the first writer on other shows however the writers work as a team sometimes they develop story ideas individually and pitch them to the shows creator who folds them together into a script and rewrites them if the show is picked up the network orders a run of episodes—usually only six or 13 episodes at first though a season typically consists of at least 22 episodes the midseason seven and last nine episodes are sometimes called the mid-seven and back nine —borrowing the colloquial terms from bowling and golf united kingdom edit the method of team writing is employed on some longer dramatic series usually running up to a maximum of around 13 episodes the idea for such a program may be generated in-house by one of the networks it could originate from an independent production company sometimes a product of both for example the bbc s long-running soap opera eastenders is wholly a bbc production whereas its popular drama life on mars was developed by kudos in association with the broadcaster however there are still a significant number of programs usually sitcoms that are built around just one or two writers and a small close-knit production team these are pitched in the traditional way but since the creator s handle all the writing requirements there is a run of six or seven episodes per series once approval has been given many of the most popular british comedies have been made this way including monty pythons flying circus albeit with an exclusive team of six writer-performers fawlty towers blackadder and the office other nations edit sirasa lakshapathi the sri lankan version of who wants to be a millionaire production edit the production company is often separate from the broadcaster the executive producer often the shows creator is in charge of running the show they pick the crew and help cast the actors approve and sometimes write series plots—some even write or direct major episodes—while various other producers help to ensure that the show runs smoothly very occasionally the executive producer will cast themselves in the show as with filmmaking or other electronic media production producing of an individual episode can be divided into three parts pre-production principal photography and post-production pre-production edit main article pre-production arthur schlesinger jr pre-production begins when a script is approved a director is chosen to plan the episodes final look pre-production tasks include storyboarding construction of sets props and costumes casting guest stars budgeting acquiring resources like lighting special effects stunts etc once the show is planned it must then be scheduled scenes are often filmed out of sequence guest actors or even regulars may only be available at certain times sometimes the principal photography of different episodes must be done at the same time complicating the schedule a guest star might shoot scenes from two episodes on the same afternoon complex scenes are translated from storyboard to animatics to further clarify the action scripts are adjusted to meet altering requirements some shows have a small stable of directors but also usually rely on outside directors given the time constraints of broadcasting a single show might have two or three episodes in pre-production one or two episodes in principal photography and a few more in various stages of post-production the task of directing is complex enough that a single director can usually not work on more than one episode or show at a time hence the need for multiple directors principal photography edit main article principal photography principal photography is the actual filming of the episode director actors and crew gather at a television studio or on location for filming or videoing a scene a scene is further divided into shots which should be planned during pre-production depending on scheduling a scene may be shot in non-sequential order of the story conversations may be filmed twice from different camera angles often using stand-ins so one actor might perform all their lines in one set of shots and then the other side of the conversation is filmed from the opposite perspective to complete a production on time a second unit may be filming a different scene on another set or location at the same time using a different set of actors an assistant director and a second unit crew a director of photography supervises the lighting of each shot to ensure consistency post-production edit main article post-production once principal photography is complete producers coordinate tasks to begin the video editing visual and digital video effects are added to the film this is often outsourced to companies specializing in these areas often music is performed with the conductor using the film as a time reference other musical elements may be previously recorded an editor cuts the various pieces of film together adds the musical score and effects determines scene transitions and assembles the completed show budgets and revenues edit most television networks throughout the world are commercial dependent on selling advertising time or acquiring sponsors broadcasting executives main concern over their programming is on audience size once the number of free to air stations was restricted by the availability of channel frequencies but cable tv outside the united states satellite television technology has allowed an expansion in the number of channels available to viewers sometimes at premium rates in a much more competitive environment in the united states the average broadcast network drama costs 3 million an episode to produce while cable dramas cost 2 million on average the pilot episode may be more expensive than a regular episode in 2004 lost s two-hour pilot cost 10  14 million in 2008 fringe s two-hour pilot cost 10 million and in 2010 boardwalk empire was 18 million for the first episode in 2011 game of thrones was 5  10 million pan am cost an estimated 10 million while terra nova s two-hour pilot was between 10 to 20 million many scripted network television shows in the united states are financed through deficit financing a studio finances the production cost of a show and a network pays a license fee to the studio for the right to air the show this license fee does not cover the shows production costs leading to the deficit although the studio does not make its money back in the original airing of the show it retains ownership of the show this ownership retention allows the studio to make its money back and earn a profit through syndication and dvd and blu-ray disc sales this system places most of the financial risk on the studios however a show that is a hit in the syndication and home video markets can more than make up for the misses although the deficit financing system places minimal financial risk on the networks they lose out on the future profits of big hits since they are only licensing the shows costs are recouped mainly by advertising revenues for broadcast networks and some cable channels while other cable channels depend on subscription revenues in general advertisers and consequently networks that depend on advertising revenues are more interested in the number of viewers within the 18 49 age range than the total number of viewers advertisers are willing to pay more to advertise on shows successful with young adults because they watch less television and are harder to reach than older adults according to advertising age during the 2007 08 season greys anatomy was able to charge 419,000 per commercial compared to only 248,000 for a commercial during csi despite csi having almost five million more viewers on average due to its strength in young demos friends was able to charge almost three times as much for a commercial as murder she wrote even though the two series had similar total viewer numbers during the seasons they were on the air together glee and the office drew fewer total viewers than ncis during the 2009 10 season but earned an average of 272,694 and 213,617 respectively compared to 150,708 for ncis distribution edit main article broadcast syndication after production the show is turned over to the television network which sends it out to its affiliate stations which broadcast it in the specified broadcast programming time slot if the nielsen ratings are good the show is kept alive as long as possible if not the show is usually canceled the shows creators are then left to shop around remaining episodes and the possibility of future episodes to other networks on especially successful series the producers sometimes call a halt to a series on their own like seinfeld the cosby show corner gas and m a s h and end it with a concluding episode which sometimes is a big series finale on rare occasions a series that has not attracted particularly high ratings and has been canceled can be given a reprieve if home video viewership has been particularly strong this has happened in the cases of family guy in the u s and peep show in the uk if the show is popular or lucrative and a number of episodes usually 100 episodes or more are made it goes into broadcast syndication in the united states where rights to broadcast the program are then resold for cash or put into a barter exchange offered to an outlet for free in exchange for airing additional commercials elsewhere in the stations broadcast day seasons series edit the terminology used to define a set of episodes produced by a television series varies from country to country north american usage edit see also serial radio and television in north american television a series is a connected set of television program episodes that run under the same title possibly spanning many seasons since the late 1960s this broadcast programming schedule typically includes between 20 and 26 episodes before then a regular television season could average out to at least 30 episodes until the 1980s most but certainly not all new programs for the broadcast networks debuted in the fall season which ran from september through march and nominally contained from 24 to 26 episodes these episodes were rebroadcast during the spring or summer season from april through august because of cable television and the nielsen sweeps the fall season now normally extends to may thus a full season on a broadcast network now usually runs from september through may for at least 22 episodes a full season is sometimes split into two separate units with a hiatus around the end of the calendar year such as the first season of jericho on cbs when this split occurs the last half of the episodes sometimes are referred to with the letter b as in the last nine episodes of the sopranos will be part of what is being called either season 6 part 2 or season 6b or in futurama is splitting its seasons similar to how south park does doing half a season at a time so this is season 6b for them since the 1990s these shorter seasons also have been referred to as .5 or half seasons where the run of shows between september and december is labeled season x and the second run between january and may labeled season x 5 examples of this include the 2004 incarnation of battlestar galactica abcs flashforward and abc familys make it or break it nowadays a new series is often ordered funded for just the first 10 to 13 episodes to gauge the audience interest if it is picked up the season is completed to the regular 20 to 26 episodes a midseason replacement is an inexpensive short-run 10 13 episode show designed to take the place of an original series that failed to garner an audience and has not been picked up a series finale is the last show of the series before the show is no longer produced in the uk it means the end of a season what is known in the united states as a season finale miniseries limited series and event series edit while network orders for 13 or 22-episode seasons are still pervasive in the television industry several popular shows have deviated from the traditional trend written to be close-ended and of shorter length than other shows they are marketed with a variety of terms miniseries is the traditional term used to describe a very short closed-ended series typically six or more hours in two or more parts nights similar to an extended television movie many early miniseries were adaptations of popular novels of the day such as the national dream 1974 roots 1977 and north and south 1985 in recent years as described by several television executives interviewed by the hollywood reporter the term miniseries has grown to have a negative connotations within the industry having become associated with melodrama -heavy works that were commonly produced under the format while limited series or event series demand higher respect limited series are distinct from miniseries in that the production is seen to have potential to be renewed but without the requirement of it having as many episodes as a typical order per season under the dome killer women and luther were marketed as limited series individual season-length stories of anthology series such as american horror story fargo and true detective are also described as limited series the primetime emmys have had to make numerous changes to their miniseries limited series category to accommodate anthology and other limited series event series is largely considered a marketing term falling under the general category of event television the term can be applied to almost any new short-run series such 24 live another day it has also been used to describe game shows like the million second quiz which aired for just two weeks uk and australia usage edit in the united kingdom and other countries these sets of episodes are referred to as a series in australia the broadcasting may be different from north american usage however the terms series and season are both used and are the same for example battlestar galactica has an original series as well as a remake both are considered a different series each with their own number of individual seasons australian television does not follow seasons in the way that u s television does for example there is no fall season or fall schedule for many years popular night-time dramas in australia would run for much of the year and would only go into recess during the summer period december–february as australia is in the southern hemisphere when ratings are not taken therefore popular dramas would usually run from february through november each year this schedule was used in the 1970s for popular dramas including number 96 many drama series such as mcleods daughters have received in the majority of between 22 and 32 episodes per season typically a soap opera such as home and away would begin a new season in late january and the season finale would air in late november with 220 230 episodes per season however during the olympics home and away would often go on hiatus which is referred to as an olympic cliffhanger therefore the number of episodes would decrease australian situation comedy series seasons are approximately 13 episodes long and premiere any time in between february and november british shows have tended toward shorter series in recent years for example the first series of long-running science fiction show doctor who in 1963 featured forty-two 25‑minute episodes this dropped to twenty-five by 1970 to accommodate changes in production and continued to 1984 for 1985 fewer but longer episodes were shown but even after a return to shorter episodes in 1986 lack of support within the bbc meant fewer episodes were commissioned leading to only fourteen 25‑minute episodes up to those in 1989 after which it was cancelled the revival of doctor who from 2005 has comprised thirteen 45‑minute installments however there are some series in the uk that have a larger number of episodes for example waterloo road started with 8 to 12 episodes but from series three onward it increased to twenty episodes and series seven will contain 30 episodes recently american non-cable networks have also begun to experiment with shorter series for some programs particularly reality shows such as survivor however they often air two series per year resulting in roughly the same number of episodes per year as a drama this is a reduction from the 1950s in which many american shows e g gunsmoke had between 29 and 39 episodes per season actual storytelling time within a commercial television hour has also gradually reduced over the years from 50 minutes out of every 60 to the current 44 and even less on some networks beginning in the early 21st century the usage of season and series differ for dvd and blu-ray releases in both australia and the uk in australia many locally produced shows are termed differently on home video releases for example a set of the television drama series packed to the rafters or wentworth is referred to as season the complete first season etc whereas drama series such as tangle are known as a series series 1 etc however british-produced shows such as mrs browns boys are referred to as season in australia for the dvd and blu-ray releases in the uk most british-produced shows are referred to as series for dvd and blu-ray except for shows such as the drama series hex and echo beach which are known as season season is only used for releases of american australian and international shows although in the past when an american series was released it was referred to as series for example friends series 1 however any subsequent re-release are now known as season running time edit in the united states dramas produced for hour-long time slots typically are 39 to 42 minutes in length excluding advertisements while sitcoms produced for 30-minute time slots typically are 18 to 21 minutes long there are exceptions as subscription-based tv channels such as hbo starz cinemax and showtime have episodes with 45 to 48 minutes of program similar to britain in britain dramas run from about 45 to 48 minutes with 57 to 59 minutes on bbc1 sitcoms vary greatly and are between 22 and 27 minutes generally and 27 to 29 minutes on bbc1 the longer duration on the national television channels bbc1 and bbc2 is due to the lack of advertising requiring time only for bridging commentary and trailers in each program slot in france most television shows whether dramas game shows or documentaries have a duration of 52 minutes this is the same on nearly all french networks tf1 france 2 france 5 m6 canal etc

architecture many artistic disciplines performing arts conceptual art textile arts involve aspects of the visual arts as well as arts of other types also included within the visual arts are the applied arts such as industrial design graphic design fashion design interior design and decorative art current usage of the term visual arts includes fine art as well as the applied decorative arts and crafts but this was not always the case before the arts and crafts movement in britain and elsewhere at the turn of the 20th century the term artist was often restricted to a person working in the fine arts such as painting sculpture or printmaking and not the handicraft craft or applied art media the distinction was emphasized by artists of the arts and crafts movement who valued vernacular art forms as much as high forms art schools made a distinction between the fine arts and the crafts maintaining that a craftsperson could not be considered a practitioner of the arts the increasing tendency to privilege painting and to a lesser degree sculpture above other arts has been a feature of western art as well as east asian art in both regions painting has been seen as relying to the highest degree on the imagination of the artist and the furthest removed from manual labour in chinese painting the most highly valued styles were those of scholar-painting at least in theory practiced by gentleman amateurs the western hierarchy of genres reflected similar attitudes education and training edit main article visual arts education training in the visual arts has generally been through variations of the apprentice and workshop systems in europe the renaissance movement to increase the prestige of the artist led to the academy system for training artists and today most of the people who are pursuing a career in arts train in art schools at tertiary levels visual arts have now become an elective subject in most education systems drawing edit main article drawing drawing is a means of making an image using any of a wide variety of tools and techniques it generally involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool or moving a tool across a surface using dry media such as graphite pencils pen and ink inked brushes wax color pencils crayons charcoals pastels and markers digital tools that simulate the effects of these are also used the

becoming common in europe by the 15th century drawing was adopted by masters such as sandro botticelli raphael michelangelo and leonardo da vinci who sometimes treated drawing as an art in its own right rather than a preparatory stage for painting or sculpture painting edit mosaic of battle of issus main article painting nefertari with isis painting taken literally is the practice of applying pigment suspended in a carrier or medium and a binding agent a glue to a surface support such as paper canvas or a wall however when used in an artistic sense it means the use of this activity in combination with drawing composition or other aesthetic considerations in order to manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner painting is also used to express spiritual motifs and ideas sites of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery to the sistine chapel to the human body itself origins and early history edit main article history of painting like drawing painting has its documented origins in caves and on rock faces the finest examples believed by some to be 32,000 years old are in the chauvet and lascaux caves in

produced by monks during the middle ages the next significant contribution to european art was from italys renaissance painters from giotto in the 13th century to leonardo da vinci and raphael at the beginning of the 16th century this was the richest period in italian art as the chiaroscuro techniques were used to create the illusion of 3-d space rembrandt the night watch painters in northern europe too were influenced by the italian school jan van eyck from belgium pieter bruegel the elder from the netherlands and hans holbein the younger from germany are among the most successful painters of the times they used the glazing technique with oils to achieve depth and luminosity claude monet déjeuner sur lherbe 1866 dutch masters edit main article dutch golden age painting the 17th

influences from the sistine chapel and created the genre of illusionistic ceiling painting much of the development that happened in the baroque was because of the protestant reformation and the resulting counter reformation much of what defines the baroque is dramatic lighting and overall visuals impressionism edit main article impressionism impressionism began in france in the 19th century with a loose association of artists including claude monet pierre-auguste renoir and paul cézanne who brought a new freely brushed style to painting often choosing to paint realistic scenes of modern life outside rather than in the studio this was achieved through a new expression of aesthetic features demonstrated by brush strokes and the impression of reality they achieved intense colour vibration by using pure unmixed colours and short brush strokes the movement influenced art as a dynamic moving through time and adjusting to new found techniques and perception of art attention to detail became less of a priority in achieving whilst exploring a biased view of landscapes and nature to the artists eye paul gauguin the vision after the sermon 1888 edvard munch the scream 1893 post-impressionism edit main article post-impressionism towards the end of the 19th century several young painters took impressionism a stage further using geometric forms and unnatural colour to depict emotions while striving for deeper symbolism of particular note are paul gauguin who was strongly influenced by asian african and japanese art vincent van gogh a dutchman who moved to france where he drew on the strong sunlight of the south and toulouse-lautrec remembered for his vivid paintings of night life in the paris district of montmartre symbolism expressionism and cubism edit main article modern art edvard munch a norwegian artist developed his symbolistic approach at the end of the 19th century inspired by the french impressionist manet the scream 1893 his most famous work is widely interpreted as representing the universal anxiety of modern man partly as a result of munchs influence the german expressionist movement originated in germany at the beginning of the 20th century as artists such as ernst kirschner and erich heckel began to distort reality for an emotional effect in parallel the style known as cubism developed in france as artists focused on the volume and space of sharp structures within a composition pablo picasso and georges braque were the leading proponents of the movement objects are broken up analyzed and re-assembled in an abstracted form by the 1920s the style had developed into surrealism with dali and magritte printmaking edit ancient chinese engraving of female instrumentalists main article printmaking printmaking is creating for artistic purposes an image on a matrix that is then transferred to a two-dimensional flat surface by means of ink or another form of pigmentation except in the case of a monotype the same matrix can be used to produce many examples of the print albrecht dürer melancholia i 1541 historically the major techniques also called media involved are woodcut line engraving etching lithography and screenprinting serigraphy silkscreening but there are many others including modern digital techniques normally the print is printed on paper but other mediums range from cloth and vellum to more modern materials major printmaking traditions include that of japan ukiyo-e european history edit main article old master print prints in the western tradition produced before about 1830 are known as old master prints in europe from around 1400 ad woodcut was used for master prints on paper by using printing techniques developed in the byzantine and islamic worlds michael wolgemut improved german woodcut from about 1475 and erhard reuwich a dutchman was the first to use cross-hatching at the end of the century albrecht dürer brought the western woodcut to a stage that has never been surpassed increasing the status of the single-leaf woodcut chinese origin and practice edit the chinese diamond sutra the worlds oldest printed book 868 ce main article woodblock printing in china the art of printmaking developed some 1,100 years ago as illustrations alongside text cut in woodblocks for printing on paper initially images were mainly religious but in the song dynasty artists began to cut landscapes during the ming 1368 1644 and qing 1616 1911 dynasties the technique was perfected for both religious and artistic engravings development in japan 1603 1867 edit hokusai red fuji southern wind clear morning from thirty-six views of mount fuji main article woodblock printing in japan woodblock printing in japan japanese moku hanga is a technique best known for its use in the ukiyo-e artistic genre however it was also used very widely for printing books in the same period woodblock printing had been used in china for centuries to print books long before the advent of movable type but was only widely adopted in japan surprisingly late during the edo period 16031867 although similar to woodcut in western printmaking in some regards moku hanga differs greatly in that water-based inks are used as opposed to western woodcut which uses oil-based inks allowing for a wide range of vivid color glazes and color transparency photography edit main article photography photography is the process of making pictures by means of the action of light light patterns reflected or emitted from objects are recorded onto a sensitive medium or storage chip through a timed exposure the process is done through mechanical shutters or electronically timed exposure of photons into chemical processing or digitizing devices known as cameras the word comes from the greek words phos light and graphis stylus paintbrush or graphê together meaning drawing with light or representation by means of lines or drawing traditionally the product of photography has been called a photograph the term photo is an abbreviation many people also call them pictures in digital photography the term image has begun to replace photograph the term image is traditional in geometric optics filmmaking edit main article filmmaking filmmaking is the process of making a motion-picture from an initial conception and research through scriptwriting shooting and recording animation or other special effects editing sound and music work and finally distribution to an audience it refers broadly to the creation of all types of films embracing documentary strains of theatre and literature in film and poetic or experimental practices and is often used to refer to video-based processes as well computer art edit main article computer art visual artists are no longer limited to traditional art media computers have been used as an ever more common tool in the visual arts since the 1960s uses include the capturing or creating of images and forms the editing of those images and forms including exploring multiple compositions and the final rendering or printing including 3d printing computer art is any in which computers played a role in production or display such art can be an image sound animation video cd-rom dvd video game website algorithm performance or gallery installation many traditional disciplines are now integrating digital technologies and as a result the lines between traditional works of art and new media works created using computers have been blurred for instance an artist may combine traditional painting with algorithmic art and other digital techniques as a result defining computer art by its end product can be difficult nevertheless this type of art is beginning to appear in art museum exhibits though it has yet to prove its legitimacy as a form unto itself and this technology is widely seen in contemporary art more as a tool rather than a form as with painting computer usage has blurred the distinctions between illustrators photographers photo editors 3-d modelers and handicraft artists sophisticated rendering and editing software has led to multi-skilled image developers photographers may become digital artists illustrators may become animators handicraft may be computer-aided or use computer-generated imagery as a template computer clip art usage has also made the clear distinction between visual arts and page layout less obvious due to the easy access and editing of clip art in the process of paginating a document especially to the unskilled observer plastic arts edit main article plastic arts plastic arts is a term now largely forgotten encompassing art forms that involve physical manipulation of a plastic medium by moulding or modeling such as sculpture or ceramics the term has also been applied to all the visual non-literary non-musical arts materials that can be carved or shaped such as stone or wood concrete or steel have also been included in the narrower definition since with appropriate tools such materials are also capable of modulation this use of the term plastic in the arts should not be confused with piet mondrian s use nor with the movement he termed in french and english neoplasticism sculpture edit main article sculpture sculpture is three-dimensional artwork created by shaping or combining hard or plastic material sound or text and or light commonly stone either rock or marble clay metal glass or wood some sculptures are created directly by finding or carving others are assembled built together and fired welded molded or cast sculptures are often painted a person who creates sculptures is called a sculptor because sculpture involves the use of materials that can be moulded or modulated it is considered one of the plastic arts the majority of public art is sculpture many sculptures together in a garden setting may be referred to as a sculpture garden sculptors do not always make sculptures by hand with increasing technology in the 20th century and the popularity of conceptual art over technical mastery more sculptors turned to art fabricators to produce their artworks with fabrication the artist creates a design and pays a fabricator to produce it this allows sculptors to create larger and more complex sculptures out of material like cement metal and plastic that they would not be able to create by hand sculptures can also be made with 3-d printing technology copyright definition of visual art us edit in the united states the law protecting the copyright over a piece of visual art gives a more restrictive definition of visual art a work

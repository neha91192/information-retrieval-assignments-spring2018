numerous reasons in many cases celebrities or public figures do not have the time discipline or writing skills to write and research a several-hundred page autobiography or how-to book even if a celebrity or public figure has the writing skills to pen a short article they may not know how to structure and edit a several-hundred page book so that it is captivating and well-paced in other cases publishers use ghostwriters to increase the number of books that can be published each year under the name of well-known highly marketable authors or to quickly release a topical book that ties in with a recent or upcoming newsworthy event roles edit ghostwriters may have varying degrees of involvement in the production of a finished work some ghostwriters are hired to edit and clean up a rough draft or partially completed work while others are hired to do most of the writing based on an outline provided by the credited author for some projects such as creating an autobiography for a celebrity ghostwriters will do a substantial amount of research ghostwriters are also hired to write fiction in the style of an existing author often as a way of increasing the number of books that can be published by a popular author ghostwriters will often spend a period from several months to a full year researching writing and editing nonfiction and fiction works for a client ghostwriters are paid either per page per each word or via total word count with a flat fee with a percentage of the royalties of the sales or by using some combination thereof the division of work between the ghostwriter and the credited author varies a great deal in some cases the ghostwriter is hired to edit a rough draft of a mostly completed manuscript in this case the outline ideas and much of the language in the finished book or article are those of the credited author if it is agreed upon for example in a signed contract the ghostwriter will sign over all the rights to everything he or she adds into the work that is not otherwise copyrighted to someone else in many cases a ghostwriter handles most of the writing using concepts and stories provided by the credited author in this case a ghostwriter will do extensive research on the credited author or their subject area of expertise it is rare for a ghostwriter to prepare a book or article with no input from the credited author at a minimum the credited author usually jots down a basic framework of ideas at the outset or provides comments on the ghostwriters final draft for an autobiography a ghostwriter will typically interview the credited author their colleagues and family members and find interviews articles and video footage about the credited author or their work for other types of nonfiction books or articles a ghostwriter will interview the credited author and review previous speeches articles and interviews with the credited author to assimilate his or her arguments and points of view most of this work can be done over email via the internet through postal mail phone or video calls and other methods of instant communication also ghostwriters may work on accompanying documents such as treatments for screenplays often ghostwriters will work on related projects beyond the scope of professional ghostwriting such as marketing promotions sales publishing or other related services for pay in order to procure more clients and increase the total amount of their business remuneration and credit edit the ghostwriter for hillary clintons memoirs received a 500,000 fee for collaborating with her ghostwriters will often spend from several months to a full year researching writing and editing nonfiction and fiction works for a client and they are paid based on a price per hour per word or per

literary agent madeleine morel states that the average ghostwriters advance for work for major book publishers is between 15,000 and 75000 these benchmark prices are mirrored approximately in the film industry by the writers guild where a minimum basic agreement gives a starting price for the screenplay writer of 37,073 non-original screenplay no treatment however the recent shift into the digital age 1520% world market share of books by 2015 has brought some changes by opening newer markets that bring their own opportunities for authors and writers —especially on the more affordable side of the ghostwriting business one such market is the shorter book best represented at the moment by amazons kindle singles imprint texts of 30,000 words and under such a length would have been much harder to sell before digital reader-technologies became widely available but is now quite acceptable writers on the level of ian mcewan have celebrated this recent change mainly for artistic reasons as a consequence the shorter format makes a project potentially more affordable for the client author manhattan literary a ghostwriting company states that book projects on the shorter side tailored to new markets like the kindle singles imprint and others 30,00042,000 words start at a cost of 15000 and this shorter book appears to be here to stay it was once financially impractical for publishers to produce such novella-length texts they would have to charge too much but this new market is by 2015 already substantial and has been projected to be a solid part of the future of book publishing so with its appearance the starting price for the professional book writer has come down by about half but only if this shorter format makes sense for the client on the upper end of the spectrum with celebrities that can all but guarantee a publisher large sales the fees can be much higher in 2001 the new york times stated that the fee that the ghostwriter for hillary clinton s memoirs will receive is probably about 500,000 of her books 8 million advance which is near the top of flat fees paid to collaborators there is also the consideration of different benchmarks in different countries in canada the writers union has established a minimum fee schedule for ghostwriting starting at 40,000 for a 200 300 page book paid at various stages of the drafting of the book research fees are an extra charge on top of this minimum fee in germany the average fee for a confidential ghostwriting service is about 100 per page the editorial freelancers association also suggests rates of 26 cents to 50 cents per word which would be about 15,000 to 30,000 for a 250-page book a recent availability also exists of outsourcing many kinds of jobs including ghostwriting to offshore locations like india china and the philippines where the customer can save money outsourced ghostwriters whose quality levels vary widely complete 200-page books for fees ranging between 3000 and 5000 or 12  18 per page the true tests of credibility—the writers track record and samples of his or her craft—become even more important in these instances when the writer comes from a culture and first-language that are entirely different from the clients in some cases ghostwriters are allowed to share credit for example a common method is to put the client authors name on a book cover as the main byline by authors name and then to put the ghostwriters name underneath it as told to ghostwriters name sometimes this is done in lieu of pay or in order to decrease the amount of payment to the book ghostwriter for whom the credit has its own intrinsic value also the ghostwriter can be cited as a coauthor of a book or listed in the movie or film credits when having ghostwritten the script or screenplay for a film production for nonfiction books the ghostwriter may be credited as a contributor or a research assistant in other cases the ghostwriter receives no official credit for writing a book or article in cases where the credited author or the publisher or both wish to conceal the ghostwriters role the ghostwriter may be asked to sign a nondisclosure contract that legally forbids any

highly marketable author ghostwriters are mostly used to pen fiction works for well-known name authors in genres such as detective fiction mysteries and teen fiction cover of the revised edition of the tower treasure the first hardy boys mystery additionally publishers use ghostwriters to write new books for established series where the author is a pseudonym for example the purported authors of the nancy drew and hardy boys mysteries carolyn keene and franklin w dixon respectively are actually pseudonyms for a series of ghostwriters who write books in the same style using a template of basic information about the books characters and their fictional universe names dates speech patterns and about the tone and style that are expected in the book for more information see the articles on pseudonyms or pen names in addition ghostwriters are often given copies of several of the previous books in the series to help them match the style the well-known web publicist keith acton rose to

the united states and united kingdom although academic ghostwriting involves the sale of academic texts that are written on demand it cannot be equated with plagiarism since it does not involve an undisclosed appropriation of existing texts as opposed to cases of plagiarism that stem from a copy-and-paste reuse of previous work essays and assignments that are obtained through ghostwriting

to combat this type of academic services which can be associated with academic fraud that are offered to students and researchers some universities allow professors to give students oral examinations on papers which a professor believes to be ghostwritten if the student is unfamiliar with the content of an essay that he or she has submitted then the student can be charged with academic fraud

have ghostwritten for symphonic recordings and films such as the rod mckuen cello concerto in the film industry a music ghostwriter is a person who composes music for another composer but is not credited on the cue sheet or in the final product in any way the practice is considered one of the dirty little secrets of the film and television music business that is considered unethical but has been common since the early stages of the film industry in the early years of film david raksin worked as music ghostwriter and orchestrator for charlie chaplin even though chaplin was credited as the score writer he was considered to be a hummer pejorative film industry slang for a person who purports to be a film score composer but who in fact only gives a general idea of the melodies to a ghostwriter the practice is also common in television as composers listed on cue sheets are entitled to music royalties every time an episode or theme score appears on television a 1998 investigation by the hollywood reporter revealed that it was especially prevalent among animation companies such as saban entertainment dic ruby-spears productions and hanna-barbera which often listed company

offered a more positive view of ghostwriting in hip hop in hip hop music the increasing use of ghostwriters by high-profile hip hop stars has led to controversy critics view the increasing use of hip hop ghostwriters as the perversion of hip-hop by commerce this is because of the limiting definition of rapping as about you expressing yourself through your own words not someone else s chuck d of public enemy thinks this point of view is mistaken because not everyone is equipped to be a lyricist and not everyone is equipped to be a vocalist he points out that creating a rap song may require multiple talents frank ocean started his career as a ghostwriter for artists such as justin bieber damienn jones john legend and brandy currently in hip-hop the credit given to ghostwriters varies

post-production wikipedia a video editing suite post-production is part of the process of filmmaking video production and photography post-production includes all stages of production occurring after shooting or recording individual program segments traditional analogue post-production has mostly been replaced by video editing software that operates on a non-linear editing system nle processes edit a sound control room at tainted blue studios 2010 post-production is many different processes grouped under one name these typically include video editing the picture of a television program using an edit decision list edl writing re recording and editing the soundtrack adding visual special effects mainly computer-generated imagery cgi and digital copy from which release prints will be made although this may be made obsolete by digital-cinema technologies sound design sound effects adr foley and music culminating in a process known as sound re-recording or mixing with professional audio equipment transfer of colour motion picture film to video or dpx with a telecine and color grading correction in a color suite the post-production phase of creating a film usually takes longer than the actual shooting of the film and can take several months to complete because it includes the complete editing colour correction and the addition of music and sound the process of editing a movie is also seen as the second directing because through post-production it is possible to change the intention of the movie furthermore through the use of color grading tools and the addition of music and sound the atmosphere of the movie can be heavily influenced for instance a blue-tinted movie is associated with a cold atmosphere and the choice of music and sound increases the effect of the shown scenes to the audience post-production was named a dying industry by phil izzo the once exclusive service offered by high-end post-production facilities have been eroded away by video editing software that operates on a non-linear editing system nle as such traditional analogue post-production services are being surpassed by digital leading to sales of over 6 billion annually television edit in television the phases of post-production include editing video editing sound editing animation and visual effects insertions viewing and the start of the airing process it is imperative that post-production executes and oversees the preparation until the final product is completely ready photography edit professional post-producers usually apply a certain range of image editing operations to the raw image format provided by a photographer or an image-bank there is a range of proprietary and free and open-source software running on a range of operating systems available to do this work the first stage of post-production usually requires loading the raw images into the post-production software if there is more than one image and they belong to a set ideally post-producers try to equalize the images before loading them after that if necessary the next step would be to cut the objects in the images with the pen tool for a perfect and clean cut the next stage would be cleaning the image using tools such as the healing tool clone tool and patch tool the next stages depend on what the client ordered if its a photo-montage the post-producers would usually start assembling the different images into the final document and start to integrate the images with the background in advertising it usually requires assembling several images together in a photo-composition types of work usually done advertising that requires one background as one or more images to assemble and one or more models usually the most time consuming as a lot of times these are image bank images which dont have much quality and they all have different light and color as they were not controlled by only one photographer in one set location product-photography that usually requires several images of the same object with different lights and assembled together to control light and unwanted reflections or to assemble parts that would be difficult to get in one shot such as a beer glass for a beer advertising sometimes to composite one image of a beer glass it requires 4 or 5 images one for the base one for the beer one for the label one for the foam and one or more for splashing beer if that is desired fashion photography that usually requires a really heavy post-production for editorial or advertising music edit techniques used in music post-production include comping compiling the best portions of multiple takes into one superior take timing and pitch correction perhaps through beat quantization and adding effects this process is typically referred to as mixing and can also involve equalization and adjusting the levels of each individual track to provide an optimal sound experience contrary to the name post-production may occur at any point during recording and production process and is non-linear and nonveridic

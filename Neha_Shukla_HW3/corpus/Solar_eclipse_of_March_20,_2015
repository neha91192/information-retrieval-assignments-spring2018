solar eclipse of march 20 2015 wikipedia a total solar eclipse occurred on march 20 2015 a solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between earth and the sun thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the sun for a viewer on earth a total solar eclipse occurs when the moons apparent diameter is larger than the suns blocking all direct sunlight turning day into darkness totality occurs in a narrow path across earths surface with a partial solar eclipse visible over a surrounding region thousands of kilometres wide it had a magnitude of 1045 the longest duration of totality was 2 minutes and 47 seconds off the coast of the faroe islands it will be the last total solar eclipse visible in europe until the eclipse of august 12 2026 the track of totality passed across the north atlantic and into the arctic ocean the only populated places from which the totality could be seen were the faroe islands and svalbard event edit the solar eclipse began at 08 30gmt in north west europe and moved towards the northeast but still in northern europe it was most visible from the north atlantic and arctic oceans greenland iceland ireland the united kingdom faroe islands northern norway and murmansk oblast the shadow began its pass off the south coast of greenland it then moved to the northeast passing between iceland and the united kingdom before moving over the faroe islands and the northernmost islands of norway the shadow of the eclipse was visible in varying degrees all over europe for example london experienced an 85% partial solar eclipse while points north of the faroe islands in the norwegian sea saw a complete solar eclipse three chartered airliners flew above the clouds giving passengers a slightly prolonged view the eclipse was observed at radio frequencies at the metsähovi radio observatory finland where a partial eclipse was seen the eclipse was also observed by meteorological satellite meteosat-10 impact edit the european union has a solar power output of about 90 gigawatts and production could have been temporarily decreased by up to 34 gw of that dependent on the clarity of the sky in actuality the dip was less than expected with a 13 gw drop in germany happening due to overcast skies this was the first time that an eclipse had a significant impact on the power system and the electricity sector took measures to mitigate the impact the power gradient change in power may be 400 mw minute and 700 mw minute places in netherlands belgium and denmark may be 80% obscured temperature may decrease by 3 °c and wind power may decrease as winds are reduced by 0.7 m s coincidence of events edit in addition to the eclipse 20 march 2015 was also the day of the march equinox also known as the spring or vernal equinox in the northern hemisphere in addition six supermoons were expected for 2015 the supermoon on 20 march 2015 was the third of the year however it was a new moon near side facing away from the sun and only its shadow was visible religious significance edit see also blood moon prophecy proponents of the blood moon prophecy such as bob odell also pointed out that 20 march 2015 was also a significant day on the jewish and biblical calendar that evening was the onset of the hebrew month of nisan the first month in the biblical calendar year furthermore the path of the total eclipse over the north pole was a highly symbolic location infusing the day with both great natural significance and profound religious meaning according to odell due to the significance of the eclipse a global prayer event in jerusalem was organized that day eclipse visibility edit the event was visible as a partial eclipse all across europe including norway sweden denmark the united kingdom ireland portugal france germany poland czech

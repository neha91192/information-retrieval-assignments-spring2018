exclusively male actors in the theatre of ancient greece performed in three types of drama tragedy comedy and the satyr play western theatre developed and expanded considerably under the romans the theatre of ancient rome was a thriving and diverse art form ranging from festival performances of street theatre nude dancing and acrobatics to the staging of situation comedies to high-style verbally elaborate tragedies as the western roman empire fell into decay through the 4th and 5th centuries the seat of roman power shifted to constantinople and the byzantine empire records show that mime pantomime scenes or recitations from tragedies and comedies dances and other entertainments were very popular from the 5th century western europe was plunged into a period of general disorder small nomadic bands of actors traveled around europe throughout the period performing wherever they could find an audience there is no evidence that they produced anything but crude scenes traditionally actors were not of high status therefore in the early middle ages traveling acting troupes were often viewed with distrust early middle ages actors were denounced by the church during the dark ages as they were viewed as dangerous immoral and pagan in many parts of europe traditional beliefs of the region and time period meant actors could not receive a christian burial in the early middle ages churches in europe began staging dramatized versions of biblical events by the middle of the 11th century liturgical drama had spread from russia to scandinavia to italy the feast of fools encouraged the development of comedy in the late middle ages plays were produced in 127 towns these vernacular mystery plays often contained comedy with actors playing devils villains and clowns the majority of actors in these plays were drawn from the local population amateur performers in england were exclusively male but other countries had female performers there were a number of secular plays staged in the middle ages the earliest of which is the play of the greenwood by adam de la halle in 1276 it contains satirical scenes and folk material such as faeries and other supernatural occurrences farces also rose dramatically in popularity after the 13th century at the end of the late middle ages professional actors began to appear in england and europe richard iii and henry vii both maintained small companies of professional actors beginning in the mid-16th century commedia dellarte troupes performed lively improvisational playlets across europe for centuries commedia dellarte was an actor-centred theatre requiring little scenery and very few props plays were loose frameworks that provided situations complications and outcome of the action around which the actors improvised the plays utilised stock characters a troupe typically consisted of 13 to 14 members most actors were paid a share of the plays profits roughly equivalent to the sizes of their roles a 1596 sketch of a performance in progress on the thrust stage of the swan a typical elizabethan open-roof playhouse renaissance theatre derived from several medieval theatre traditions such as the mystery plays morality plays and the university drama that attempted to recreate athenian tragedy the italian tradition of commedia dellarte as well as the elaborate masques frequently presented at court also contributed to the shaping of public theatre since before the reign of elizabeth i companies of players were attached to households of leading aristocrats and performed seasonally in various locations these became the foundation for the professional players that performed on the elizabethan stage the development of the theatre and opportunities for acting ceased when puritan opposition to the stage banned the performance of all plays within london puritans viewed the theatre as immoral the re-opening of the theatres in 1660 signaled a renaissance of english drama english comedies written and performed in the restoration period from 1660 to 1710 are collectively called restoration comedy restoration comedy is notorious for its sexual explicitness at this point women were allowed for the first time to appear on the english stage exclusively in female roles this period saw the introduction of the first professional actresses and the rise of the first celebrity actors 19th century edit henry irving in the bells 1874 in the 19th century the negative reputation of actors was largely reversed and acting became an honored popular profession and art the rise of the actor as celebrity provided the transition as audiences flocked to their favorite stars a new role emerged for the actor-managers who formed their own companies and controlled the actors the productions and the financing when successful they built up a permanent clientele that flocked to their productions they could enlarge their audience by going on tour across the country performing a repertoire of well-known plays such as those by shakespeare the newspapers private clubs pubs and coffee shops rang with lively debates evaluating the relative merits of the stars and the productions henry irving 1838 1905 was the most successful of the british actor-managers irving was renowned for his shakespearean roles and for such innovations as turning out the house lights so that attention could focus more on the stage and less on the audience his company toured across britain as well as europe and the united states demonstrating the power of star actors and celebrated roles to attract enthusiastic audiences his knighthood in 1895 indicated full acceptance into the higher circles of british society 20th century edit by the early 20th century the economics of large-scale productions displaced the actor-manager model it was too hard to find people who combined a genius at acting as well as management so specialization divided the roles as stage managers and later theatre directors emerged financially much larger capital was required to operate out of a major city the solution was corporate ownership of chains of theatres such as by the theatrical syndicate edward laurillard and especially the shubert organization by catering to tourists theaters in large cities increasingly favored long runs of highly popular plays especially musicals big name stars became even more

saint-denis in stanislavskis system also known as stanislavskis method actors draw upon their own feelings and experiences to convey the truth of the character they portray actors puts themselves in the mindset of the character finding things in common to give a more genuine portrayal of the character method acting is a range of techniques based on for training actors to achieve better characterizations of the characters they play as formulated by lee strasberg strasbergs method is based upon the idea that to develop an emotional and cognitive understanding of their roles actors should use their own experiences to identify personally with their characters it is based on aspects of stanislavskis system other acting techniques are also based on stanislavskis ideas such as those of stella adler and sanford meisner but these are not considered method acting meisner technique requires the actor to focus totally on the other actor as though he or she is real and they only exist

the medieval world it was considered disgraceful for a woman to go on stage this belief persisted until the 17th century in venice in the time of william shakespeare womens roles were generally played by men or boys when an eighteen-year puritan prohibition of drama was lifted after the english restoration of 1660 women began to appear on stage in england margaret hughes is oft credited as the first professional actress on the english stage this prohibition ended during the reign of charles ii in part because he enjoyed watching actresses on stage the first occurrence of the term actress was in 1608 according to the oed and is ascribed to middleton in the 19th century many viewed women in acting negatively as actresses were often courtesans and associated with promiscuity despite

there in the 2000s women playing men in live theatre is particularly common in presentations of older plays such as shakespearean works with large numbers of male characters in roles where gender is inconsequential having an actor dress as the opposite sex for comic effect is also a long-standing tradition in comic theatre and film most of shakespeares comedies include instances of overt cross-dressing such as francis flute in a midsummer nights dream the movie a funny thing happened on the way to the forum stars jack gilford dressing as a young bride tony curtis and jack lemmon famously posed as women to escape gangsters in the billy wilder film some like it hot cross-dressing for comic effect was a frequently used device in most of the carry on films dustin hoffman and robin williams have each appeared in a hit comedy film tootsie and mrs doubtfire respectively in which they played most scenes dressed as a woman occasionally the issue is further complicated for example by a woman playing a woman acting as a man—who then pretends to be a woman such as julie andrews in victor victoria or gwyneth paltrow in shakespeare in love in its pat the movie filmwatchers never learn the gender of the androgynous main characters pat and chris played by julia sweeney and dave foley similarly in the aforementioned example of the marriage of figaro there is a scene in which cherubino a male character portrayed by a woman dresses up and acts as a woman the other characters in the scene are aware of a single level of gender role obfuscation while the audience is aware of two levels a few modern roles are played by a member of the opposite sex in order to emphasize the gender fluidity of the role edna turnblad in hairspray was played by divine in the 1988

popular origin for many american silent film actors the pervading presence of stage actors in film was the cause of this outburst from director marshall neilan in 1917 the sooner the stage people who have come into pictures get out the better for the pictures in other cases directors such as john griffith wray required their actors to deliver larger-than-life expressions for emphasis as early as 1914 american viewers had begun to make known their preference for greater naturalness on screen pioneering film directors in europe and the united states recognized the different limitations and freedoms of the mediums of stage and screen by the early 1910s silent films became less vaudevillian in the mid 1910s as the differences between stage and screen became apparent due to the work of

metropolis were still being released according to anton kaes a silent film scholar from the university of wisconsin american silent cinema began to see a shift in acting techniques between 1913 and

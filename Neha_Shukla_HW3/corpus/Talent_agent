music world booking agents are different from talent managers booking agents are the people who actually book shows for the artists they represent these agents make all of the arrangements with the promoters of the shows the booking agent presents the promoter or producer of the concert with a performance agreement which stipulates the artists requirements items may include lighting sound meals hotel accommodations and transportation for concert buyers they work to find the artist who will fit in the need and available budget many of the major booking agencies refuse to represent clients who are not already signed to a major record label and have national distribution of their music because of this artists on independent record labels often seek representation with an independent booking agency bars and nightclubs that specialize in presenting live music on a regular basis often employ an individual to assemble the schedule of events this individual is the venues buyer and should not be confused with the booking agent who presents a roster of available acts to the buyer booking agents may also have contacts known as free-lance promoters these are individuals who agree to produce a concert by locating a venue providing a sound system and assembling a staff producing a show in this manner at a location rented out for a single evening is called four-walling as the process entails renting a venue and receiving no additional services or technical equipment other than the space itself this has often been the only available option for underground musicians lacking enough popular appeal to gain access to more conventional performance venues see punk rock but is also used among the genre of raves and various dj-related events the cost factor of having a booking agent must be weighed against what the agent can do for clients and buyers alike some agents represent several different types of artists while others represent artists in one main area genre some music agencies deal exclusively with cover bands listing exclusive and non-exclusive artists on their rosters in addition some agencies will also work with a third party company to build specific bands using their own database of vetted musicians whilst other cover band agencies work with session musicians that provide a flexible line up for each act cruise ship industry edit booking agents are also used for the cruise ship industry where several different categories of entertainers are needed these can include individual musicians to be part of the ships orchestra small bands and ensembles as well as

casting websites is emerging in an industry where radio and television voice overs can be recorded in home studios because of technology becoming so affordable high paying jobs are no longer sourced exclusively through traditional voice talent agents history edit since the decline in viewership in theaters from the 1950s to 1960s a monumental shift occurred in how studios produced films and reduced the cost of exclusive and expensive actors after the shift actors and actresses were working for the studios but were not owned by one major studio entity and so were able to work with other studios this shift has meant that agents were now seen as a necessity instead of an option agents became third parties who negotiated between studios and clients making the need for the agents services an imperative for each party in the 1980s new agencies were established to compete with the big five in 1991 bauer-benedek merged with leading artists agency to form what became united talent agency these agencies were traid artists and intertalent traid artist would eventually be sold to william morris agency in 1992 and intertalent would diminish when its partners dispersed between uta and icm in the same year by the 2000s hollywoods largest talent agencies were known as the big five or top five creative artists agency caa william morris agency wma united talent agency uta international creative management icm and endeavor in 2009 two of the agencies endeavor and the william morris agency merged to form william morris endeavor wme in 2012 international creative management completed a management buyout and formed a partnership with the new name icm partners difference between agents and managers edit the difference between the roles of agents and managers has become smaller and more blurred a frequent definition of the role of a talent manager is to oversee the day-to-day business affairs of an artist advise and counsel talent concerning professional matters long-term plans and personal decisions which may affect their career considerable overlap exists as talent agents may opt to fill exactly the same roles for their clients out of a financial interest in developing the careers of their talent and currying their favor various state laws and labor guild rules govern the roles reserved to agents as well as specifying certain special rights privileges and prohibitions in the state of california the labor code requires licensing of talent agencies and includes regulations such as criminal background checks maintaining separate operating accounts and client trust accounts and limits total commissions to twenty-five percent among other regulations in contrast management companies are described as often unregulated agents also have certain privileged powers in situations of verbal agreement and can legally agree to a binding employment offer on behalf of their client a prominent difference between agents and managers under california state law is that licensed talent agents and employment agents are the only entities legally allowed to seek work on behalf of their clients this legal distinction has enabled artists such as the deftones pamela anderson nia vardalos freddie prinze jr and others to break contracts with their managers and avoid commissions owed according to those contracts by proving unlicensed procurement in court because the enforcement against talent managers procuring work is largely carried out through civil litigation and not criminal penalties managers directly seek out work in defiance of state laws as clients out of self-interest will seldom object to them doing so and cases alleging illegal procurement are infrequent the writers guild screen actors guild and directors guild among labor guilds strike agency franchise agreements that specify certain regulations and privileges reserved solely for agents including setting maximum commissions at ten percent of a talents gross earnings managers do not face the same restrictions

wga screenwriting credit system wikipedia writing credits for the last time i saw paris julius j philip g epstein wrote one or more drafts together richard brooks worked on later drafts the film was adapted from f scott fitzgerald s short story babylon revisited in the united states writing credit for motion pictures and television programs written under the jurisdiction of the writers guild of america east wgae and the writers guild of america west wgaw is determined by the writers guild of america wga which is composed of members of the wgae and the wgaw since 1941 the wga has been the final arbiter of who receives credit for writing a theatrical television or new media motion picture written under the wgas jurisdiction a production company that signs the wga theatrical and television basic agreement mba must comply with the wga rules on writing credits rationale edit the system affects reputation union membership and income it affects reputation since some sources list only wgae or wgaw determined writing credits john howard lawson the first president of the screen writers guild the wgaws former name said a writers name is his most cherished possession it is his creative personality the symbol of the whole body of his ideas and experience the credit system can affect eligibility for membership in the union as one way in which a person becomes a member of the wgaw is by accruing points which are awarded based on the individuals writing credit membership points are also accrued through employment by or sale or option to a company that is signatory to the mba it can also affect income while all writers are paid when they work some contracts limit contingent compensation to writers if they are not officially credited additionally only credited writers typically receive residual income from future exploitation of a film on video pay-per-view broadcast television etc process edit on completion of a film or television motion picture the producer submits to the wga and to all eligible participating writers a notice of tentative writing credits ntwc which sets forth the proposed writing credits for the project and circulates the final shooting script to all participating writers employed on the script a participating writer is a writer who was either 1 employed by the company to perform writing services on the project or who 2 sold literary material to the company and is a professional writer as that term is defined in the mba if any participating writer objects to the proposed credits credit for the film enters arbitration in addition if a production executive i e the director or producer of the film is being proposed for writing credit and there are other non-production executive participating writers on the project an automatic arbitration is required an automatic arbitration is also required when three writers are proposed for screenplay by teleplay by or written by credit when an adaptation by credit is proposed when a screen story by or television story by credit is proposed and with television and new media series only when a developed by credit is proposed and there is a writer who is entitled to separated rights in the series in arbitration guild members review all drafts of the screenplay by each writer and determine writing credit on the project based on the rules set forth in the scm or the tvcm the credit rules differ for theatrical motion pictures and television new media motion pictures on a theatrical motion picture the applicable rules depend on whether the screenplay is classified as an original screenplay or a non-original screenplay an original screenplay is a screenplay that is not based on source material and on which the first writer writes a screenplay without there being any intervening literary material by another writer pertaining to the project source material is defined as material assigned to the writer which was previously published or exploited and upon which the writers work is to be based e g a novel a produced play or series of published articles or any other material written outside of the guilds jurisdiction in the case of an original screenplay the first writer must contribute more than 33% of the screenplay to receive screenplay by credit subsequent writers must contribute 50% of the screenplay to receive screenplay by credit unless the subsequent writer is a production executive a producer or director who must contribute more than 50% of the screenplay to receive screenplay by credit a non-original screenplay is a screenplay that is based upon source material and all other screenplays that do not qualify as original screenplays such as sequels in the case of a non-original screenplay any writer who contributes more than 33% of the screenplay is entitled to screenplay by credit there is no heightened percentage for production executives on a television or new media motion picture the credit rules are the same regardless of whether the participating writer is a production executive any subsequent writer who contributes substantially more than the first writer on a television or new media motion picture is entitled to teleplay by credit credit can be apportioned separately for the story and for the screenplay or teleplay itself when all writers were not equally involved in the creation of both story is defined as all writing covered by the mba representing a contribution distinct from screenplay and consisting of basic narrative idea theme or outline indicating character development screenplay for theatrical motion pictures and teleplay for television and new media motion pictures is generally defined as the final script as represented on the screen with individual scenes and full dialogue together with such prior treatment basic adaptation continuity scenario and dialogue as shall be used in and represent substantial contributions to the final script when the same writer or writers are entitled to both screenplay by and story by credit or teleplay by and story by credit the credit will read written by a writing team is considered a single writer a team is identified by the use of an ampersand between the names of the members of the team the names of writers or writing teams who wrote individually of one another are separated by the word and so a credit reading john doe richard roe and jane doe jane roe means that there were two writing teams john and richard on one and the two janes on the other and they were working on the script at different times one after the other an individual writer who works on a script independently of a team or another independent writer will also have his her name joined to the list of credits by an and in the case of a sequel to a theatrical motion picture the credited writers of the original motion picture must receive the credit based on characters created by if they had separated rights in the original motion picture if there are no separated rights in the original motion picture the based on characters created by credit is discretionary in television and new media based on characters created by is only required in the case of a sequel to an mow movie-of the week e g a long-form television motion picture if the writers of the mow on which the sequel is based have separated rights in any other case based on characters created by is discretionary screenplay by teleplay by and written by credit cannot be shared by more than three writers or writing teams and then only as the result of arbitration the wga also permits use of a reasonable pseudonym if a writer requests one in a timely fashion but the wga may also refuse to accept a pseudonym if it is designed only to make a statement for example screenwriter j michael straczynski wanted to take his name off the babylon 5 spin-off series crusade and substitute eiben scrood i been screwed to protest script changes the production company made according to straczynski the wgaw refused because it diminished the value of the show and basically made light of the studio story by edit there is a common misconception that a story by credit may be given to a person who simply has the story idea for a film or television program this is never the case as all writing credits are for actual writing a written story document or treatment or in some cases a complete script are required to receive story by credit a writer may be only accorded a story by credit if for example a subsequent writer does a page one rewrite that entitles him her to sole screenplay by credit despite the initial writer having written a complete script for theatrical motion pictures only the first writer on an original screenplay is titled to no less than shared story by credit this is known as the irreducible story minimum examples edit here are some complicated examples of wga-approved exceptions to writer-only credit the rock 1996 story by david weisberg douglas s cook screenplay by douglas s cook david weisberg and mark rosner armageddon 1998 story by robert roy pool and jonathan hensleigh adaptation by tony gilroy and shane salerno screenplay by jonathan hensleigh and j j abrams scary movie 4 2006 —the original scary movie was based on a combination of two scripts causing its sequels to have increasingly complicated writing credits screenplay by craig mazin jim abrahams pat proft story by craig mazin based on characters created by shawn wayans marlon wayans buddy johnson phil beauman and jason friedberg aaron seltzer the heartbreak kid 2007 —a remake of the 1972 film of the same name which was based on a short story based on the screenplay by neil simon based on the short story a change of plan by bruce jay friedman screenplay by scot armstrong and leslie dixon and bobby farrelly peter farrelly kevin barnett pirates of the caribbean on stranger tides 2011 —the fourth film in the series based on the theme park ride the plot of this film was taken from a novel suggested by the novel by tim powers based on walt disney s pirates of the caribbean based on characters created by ted elliott terry rossio and stuart beattie and jay wolpert screen story and screenplay by ted elliott terry rossio arbitration edit some wga members have criticized the arbitration process the wga however has won most lawsuits against them and in 2002 the wga membership overwhelmingly rejected changes to the arbitration procedures in 2010 however the wga membership approved a reformat of the television credits manual and a change to the rule for non-original screenplays in the screen credits manual allowing any writer who contributes more than 33% of the screenplay to receive credit thereby eliminating the heightened percentage for production executives a credit arbitration consists of three wga members reading all of the literary and source material for a project and based on the applicable rules in the scm or tvcm determining what the appropriate writing credit on the project should be each participating writer may elect to submit a statement to the arbitration committee making their case for writing credit but such statements are not evidence and the arbitration committee must base its decision solely on the literary materials the identities of the arbiters are secret each participating writer on an arbitration however is given a list of all writers who are eligible to act as arbiters each participating writer has the right to challenge a reasonable number of names on the arbiters list and those members who have been challenged will not be solicited to read the arbitration each member of the arbitration committee reads all of the materials selected by the participating writers for consideration and any source material independently of the other members and makes his her credit determination the decision of the arbitration committee need not be unanimous and if a unanimous decision cannot be reached the majority decision is deemed the decision of the arbitration committee once the arbitration committee has reached its decision each participating writer is notified of the determination each writer has 24 hours from the time s he is advised of the decision of the arbitration committee to request an appeal before a policy review board prb this is a strict 24-hour period if a writer is notified at 10 35 a m on monday of the decision s he has until 10 35 a m on tuesday to request an appeal in order to determine whether to seek a prb the participating writers are entitled to see the written decisions of the arbitration committee which are coded to preserve anonymity a prb is a procedural review only the members of the prb are not permitted to read the material and substitute their judgment as to the proper credit for that of arbitration committee rather the prb can only review the conduct of the arbitration to determine if any of the following grounds exist 1 dereliction of duty on the part of the arbitration committee or any of its members 2 the use of undue influence upon the arbitration committee or any of its members 3 the misinterpretation misapplication or violation of guild policy or 4 availability of important literary or source material for valid reasons not previously available to the arbitration committee wga members have criticized the way the process handles existing material such as a book that is adapted to film generally the first writer to work on such a project naturally appropriates the most cinematic elements of the story other teams that subsequently work on the script however may base their work on the original text rather than that first draft barry levinson the director of wag the dog and a disputant over screenwriting credit for the film which was adapted from a novel says if a writer creates an idea from scratch thats one thing even if the script is given to other writers and rewritten that first writer created the seeds of that idea and he or she should get some regard but for a script from a book its different even if little of the initial efforts remain in the final script the original writer is often awarded credit because he or she was first on the scene conflict and resolution examples edit frank pierson former wgaw president and former president of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences says that the large majority of credits are still straightforward and uncontested but when they go wrong they go horribly wrong writer-director phil alden robinson says no one can trust the writing credit nobody knows who really wrote the film when hunter s thompson s fear and loathing in las vegas was adapted for the screen alex cox and tod davies wrote the initial adaptation when terry gilliam was brought in to direct he rewrote it with tony grisoni the wga initially denied gilliam and grisoni any credit even though gilliam claimed nothing of the original adaptation remained in the final film as a director i was automatically deemed a production executive by the guild and by definition discriminated against but for tony to go without any credit would be really unfair after complaints the wga did award gilliam and grisoni credit in addition to cox and davies but gilliam resigned from the union over the dispute its really a star chamber said gilliam of the arbitration process which he claimed took more work than the screenplay itself similar problems arose for the film ronin according to director john frankenheimer the credits should read story by j d zeik screenplay by david mamet we didnt shoot a line of zeiks script instead mamet received credit under a pseudonym after the controversy over credits for wag the dog mamet reportedly has decided to attach his name only to movies on which he is the sole writer an example in television is the show lost this began as an idea from abc television executive lloyd braun for a series similar to the tom hanks movie cast away writer jeffrey lieber was brought in to flesh out the idea into a treatment lieber wrote a pilot script for a series he called nowhere abc passed on liebers idea and instead brought in j j abrams to create the show abrams and damon lindelof produced the version of the show which would eventually be aired lieber however asked for wga arbitration and the wga ruled that he had contributed significantly enough to the final concept of lost to receive credit from 1993 to 1997 there were 415 arbitrations about one-third of all films whose credits were submitted

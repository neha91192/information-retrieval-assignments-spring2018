century what the great american novel was for the first half closet writers who used to dream of the glory of getting into print now dream of seeing their story on the big or small screen film industry edit every screenplay and teleplay begins with a thought or idea and screenwriters use their ideas to write scripts with the intention of selling them and having them produced in some cases the script is based on an existing property such as a book or persons life story which is adapted by the screenwriter the majority of the time a film project gets initiated by a screenwriter the initiator of the project gets the exclusive writing assignment they are referred to as exclusive assignments or pitched assignments screenwriters who often pitch new projects whether original or an adaptation often do not have to worry about competing for assignments and are often more successful when word is put out about a project a film studio production company or producer wants done they are referred to as open assignments open assignments are more competitive if screenwriters are competing for an open assignment more-established writers usually win the assignments a screenwriter can also be approached and personally offered a writing assignment script doctoring edit many screenwriters also work as full or part-time script doctors attempting to better a script to suit the desires of a director or studio for instance studio management may have a complaint that the motivations of the characters are unclear or that the dialogue is weak script-doctoring can be quite lucrative especially for the better-known writers david mamet and john sayles for instance fund the movies that they direct themselves usually from their own screenplays by writing and doctoring scripts for others in fact some writers make very profitable careers out of being the ninth or tenth writer to work on a piece and they often work on projects that never see exposure to an audience of any size many up-and-coming screenwriters also ghostwrite projects and allow more-established screenwriters to take public credit for the project to increase the chances of it getting picked up development process edit after a screenwriter finishes a project he or she pairs with an industry-based representative such as a producer director literary agent entertainment lawyer or entertainment executive the partnerships often pitch their project to investors or others in a position to further a project once the script is sold the writer has only the rights that were agreed with the purchaser a screenwriter becomes credible by having work that is recognized which gives the writer the opportunity to earn a higher income as more films are produced independently outside the studio system many up-and-coming screenwriters are turning to pitch fests screenplay contests and independent development services to gain access to established and credible independent producers many development executives are now working independently to incubate their own pet projects production involvement edit screenwriters are rarely involved in the development of a film sometimes they come on as advisors or if they are established as a producer some screenwriters also direct although many scripts are sold each year many do not make it into production because the number of scripts that are purchased every year exceeds the number of professional directors that are working in the film and tv industry when a screenwriter finishes a project and sells it to a film studio production company tv network or producer he or she often has to continue networking mainly with directors or executives and push to have their projects chosen and turned into films or tv shows if interest in a script begins to fade a project can go dead union edit most professional screenwriters in the u s are unionized and are represented by the writers guild of america although membership in the wga is recommended it is not required of a screenwriter to join the wga is the final arbiter on awarding writing credit for projects under its jurisdiction the wga also looks upon and verifies film copyright

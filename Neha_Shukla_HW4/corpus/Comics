fallen prey to numerous exceptions theorists such as töpffer r c harvey will eisner david carrier alain rey and lawrence grove emphasize the combination of text and images though there are prominent examples of pantomime comics throughout its history other critics such as thierry groensteen and scott mccloud have emphasized the primacy of sequences of images towards the close of the 20th century different cultures discoveries of each others comics traditions the rediscovery of forgotten early comics forms and the rise of new forms made defining comics a more complicated task european comics studies began with töpffers theories of his own work in the 1840s which emphasized panel transitions and the visual–verbal combination no further progress was made until the 1970s pierre fresnault-deruelle then took a semiotics approach to the study of comics analyzing text–image relations page-level image relations and image discontinuities or what scott mccloud later dubbed closure

to artists poïetic creative choices thierry smolderen and harry morgan have held relativistic views of the definition of comics a medium that has taken various equally valid forms over its history morgan sees comics as a subset of les littératures dessinées or drawn literatures french theory has come to give special attention to the page in distinction from american theories such as mcclouds which focus on panel-to-panel transitions since the mid-2000s neil cohn has begun analyzing how comics are understood using tools from cognitive science extending beyond theory by using actual psychological and neuroscience experiments this work has argued that sequential images and page layouts both use separate rule-bound grammars to be understood that extend beyond panel-to-panel transitions and categorical distinctions of types of layouts and that the brains comprehension of comics is similar to comprehending other domains such as language and music historical narratives of manga tend to focus either on its recent post-wwii history or on attempts to demonstrates deep roots in the past such as to the chōjū-jinbutsu-giga picture scroll of the 12th and 13th centuries or the early 19th-century hokusai manga the first historical overview of japanese comics was seiki hosokibaras nihon manga-shi in 1924 early post-war japanese criticism was mostly of a left-wing political nature until the 1986 publication for tomofusa kures modern manga the complete picture which de-emphasized politics in favour of formal aspects such as structure and a grammar of comics the field of manga studies increased rapidly with numerous books on the subject appearing in the 1990s formal theories of manga have focused on developing a manga expression theory with emphasis on spatial relationships in the structure of images on the page distinguishing the medium from film or literature in which the flow of time is the basic organizing element comics studies courses have proliferated at japanese universities and japan society for studies in cartoon and comics ja was established in 2001 to promote comics scholarship the publication of frederik l schodt s manga manga

scott mccloud s understanding comics 1993 were early attempts in english to formalize the study of comics david carriers the aesthetics of comics 2000 was the first full-length treatment of comics from a philosophical perspective prominent american attempts at definitions of comics include eisners mcclouds and harveys eisner described what he called sequential art as the arrangement of pictures or images and words to narrate a story or dramatize an idea scott mccloud defined comics as juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence intended to convey information and or to produce an aesthetic response in the viewer a strictly formal definition which detached comics from its historical and cultural trappings r c harvey defined comics as pictorial narratives or expositions in which words often lettered into the picture area within speech balloons usually contribute to the meaning of the pictures and vice versa each definition has had its detractors harvey saw mcclouds definition as excluding single-panel cartoons and objected to mcclouds de-emphasizing verbal elements insisting the essential characteristic of comics is the incorporation of verbal content aaron meskin saw mcclouds theories as an artificial attempt to legitimize the place of comics in art history cross-cultural study of comics is complicated by the great difference in meaning

moments in a narrative are broken down into panels via a process called encapsulation the reader puts the pieces together via the process of closure by using background knowledge and an understanding of panel relations to combine panels mentally into events the size shape and arrangement of panels each affect the timing and pacing of the narrative the contents of a panel may be asynchronous with events depicted in the same image not necessarily occurring at the same time a caption the yellow box gives the narrator a voice the characters dialogue appears in speech balloons the tail of the balloon indicates the speaker text is frequently incorporated into comics via speech balloons captions and sound effects speech balloons indicate dialogue or thought in the case of thought balloons with tails pointing at their respective speakers captions can give voice to a narrator convey characters dialogue or thoughts or indicate place or time speech balloons themselves are strongly associated with comics such that the addition of one to an image is sufficient to turn the image into comics sound effects mimic non-vocal sounds textually using onomatopoeia sound-words cartooning is most frequently used in making comics traditionally using ink especially india ink with dip pens or ink brushes mixed media and digital technology have become common cartooning techniques such as motion lines and abstract symbols are often employed while comics are often the work of a single creator the labour of making them is frequently divided between a number of specialists there may be separate writers and artists and artists may specialize in parts of the artwork such as characters or backgrounds as is common in japan particularly in american superhero comic books the art may be divided between a penciller who lays out the artwork in pencil an inker who finishes the artwork in ink a colourist and a letterer who adds the captions and speech balloons etymology edit the

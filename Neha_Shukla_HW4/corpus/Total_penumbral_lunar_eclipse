total penumbral lunar eclipse wikipedia the penumbral lunar eclipse on march 14 2006 was a total penumbral eclipse a total penumbral eclipse is a lunar eclipse that occurs when the moon becomes completely immersed in the penumbral cone of the earth without touching the umbra it is a narrow path for the moon to pass within the penumbra and outside the umbra it can happen on the earths northern or southern penumbral edges in addition the size of the penumbra is sometimes too small where the moon enters it to contain the moon the width of the earths penumbra is determined by the suns angular diameter at the time of the eclipse and the moons angular diameter is larger than the sun over part of its elliptical orbit depending on whether the eclipse occurs at its nearest perigee or farthest point apogee in its orbit around the earth the majority of the time the size of the moon and the size of the earths penumbra where the moon crosses it mean that most eclipses will not be total penumbral in nature frequency edit such eclipses constitute a relatively small fraction of lunar eclipses and the distribution of these events is uneven occurring between 0 and 9 times per century the period of this variation is about 600 years and also correlates with the frequency of total umbral eclipses and tetrads the maximum number in freds 5k canon https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/lecat5/lecatalog.html is 8 for saros 19 see https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/lesaros/lesaros019.html saros 32 and 132 have 7 saros 58 95 and 114 have 6 114 is the only saros in the canon to have a total of 7 total penumbral lunar eclipses that are not all in a row and see also this table from http://www.marco-peuschel.de/ saros 339 8x saros 266 13x saros 258 9x saros 247 10x saros 237 9x saros 218 12x saros 157 7x saros 118 7x saros 116 7x saros 105 11x saros 39 9x saros 26 8x saros 19 8x saros 32 7x saros 58 6x saros 114 6x saros 132 7x and see also http://www.jir1667.plus.com/shadow/consecutive-penumbral-total-lunar-eclipses.png red dots means positieve gamma and blue dots means negative gamma or this juist inverted source https://www.iau.org/administration/membership/individual/6886/ summary frequency of total penumbral total umbral and tetrad events 501 2500 edit the frequency of total penumbral lunar eclipses varies by century with the frequency of total umbral eclipses a tetrad is a set of four total umbral eclipses within two years list of total penumbral lunar eclipse events 1901 2100 edit

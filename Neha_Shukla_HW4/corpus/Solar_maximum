solar maximum wikipedia for the spacecraft see solar maximum mission main article solar cycle the current prediction for sunspot cycle 24 gives a smoothed sunspot number maximum of about 66 in the summer of 2013 the smoothed sunspot number has already reached 67 in february 2012 due to the strong peak in late 2011 so the official maximum will be at least this high the smoothed sunspot number has been flat over the last four months we are currently over four years into cycle 24 the current predicted and observed size makes this the smallest sunspot cycle since cycle 14 which had a maximum of 64.2 in february 1906 nasa solar maximum or solar max is a regular period of greatest sun activity during the 11-year solar cycle during solar maximum large numbers of sunspots appear and the solar irradiance output grows by about 007% the increased energy output of solar maxima can impact earths global climate and recent studies have shown some correlation with regional weather patterns at solar maximum the suns magnetic field lines are the most distorted due to the magnetic field on the solar equator rotating at a slightly faster pace than at the solar poles on average the solar cycle takes about 11 years to go from one solar maximum to the next with duration observed varying from 9 to 14 years three recent solar cycles large solar flares often occur during a maximum for example the solar storm of 1859 struck the earth with such intensity that the northern lights were visible as far from the poles as cuba and hawaii predictions edit predictions of a future maximums timing and strength are very difficult predictions vary widely there was a solar maximum in 2000 in 2006 nasa initially expected a solar maximum in 2010 or 2011 and thought that it could be the strongest since 1958 however the solar maximum was not declared to have occurred until 2014 and even then was ranked among the weakest on record film edit imax documentary about solar maximum called solarmax nasa cme documentary x class corona mass ejection 2012 07 14 documentary grand solar minima and maxima edit main article solar variation grand solar maxima occur when several solar cycles exhibit greater than average activity for decades or centuries solar cycles still occur during these grand solar maximum periods but the intensity of those cycles is greater grand solar maxima have shown some correlation with global and regional climate changes 400 year history of sunspot numbers the idea of a modern maximum has now been thrown into question with the release of a paper at the international astronomical union general assembly in august 2015 a list of historical grand minima of solar activity includes also grand minima ca 690 ad 360 bc 770 bc 1390 bc 2860 bc 3340 bc 3500 bc 3630 bc 3940 bc 4230 bc 4330 bc 5260 bc 5460 bc 5620 bc 5710 bc 5990 bc 6220 bc 6400 bc 7040 bc 7310 bc 7520 bc 8220 bc 9170 bc

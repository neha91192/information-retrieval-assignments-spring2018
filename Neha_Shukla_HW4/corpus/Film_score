film score wikipedia movie music redirects here for the albums by braid see movie music vol 1 and movie music vol 2 film music redirects here for the album by mark isham see film music album a film score also sometimes called background score background music film soundtrack film music or incidental music is original music written specifically to accompany a film the score forms part of the films soundtrack which also usually includes pre-existing music dialogue and sound effects and comprises a number of orchestral instrumental or choral pieces called cues which are timed to begin and end at specific points during the film in order to enhance the dramatic narrative and the emotional impact of the scene in question scores are written by one or more composers under the guidance of or in collaboration with the films director or producer and are then usually performed by an ensemble of musicians most often comprising an orchestra or band instrumental soloists and choir or vocalists and recorded by a sound engineer film scores encompass an enormous variety of styles of music depending on the nature of the films they accompany the majority of scores are orchestral works rooted in western classical music but many scores are also influenced by jazz rock pop blues new-age and ambient music and a wide range of ethnic and world music styles since the 1950s a growing number of scores have also included electronic elements as part of the score and many scores written today feature a hybrid of orchestral and electronic instruments since the invention of digital technology and audio sampling many modern films have been able to rely on digital samples to imitate the sound of live instruments and many scores are created and performed wholly by the composers themselves by using sophisticated music composition software songs are usually not considered part of the films score although songs do also form part of the films soundtrack although some songs especially in musicals are based on thematic ideas from the score or vice versa scores usually do not have lyrics except for when sung by choirs or soloists as part of a cue similarly pop songs which are needle dropped into a specific scene in film for added emphasis are not considered part of the score although occasionally the scores composer will write an original pop song based on their themes such as james horner s my heart will go on from titanic written for celine dion process of creation edit spotting edit the composer usually enters the creative process towards the end of filming at around the same time as the film is being edited although on some occasions the composer is on hand during the entire film shoot especially when actors are required to perform with or be aware of original diegetic music the composer is shown an unpolished rough cut of the film before the editing is completed and talks to the director or producer about what sort of music is required for the film in terms of style and tone the director and composer will watch the entire film taking note of which scenes require original music during this process the composer will take precise timing notes so that he or she knows how long each cue needs to last where it begins where it ends and of particular moments during a scene with which the music may need to coincide in a specific way this process is known as spotting occasionally a filmmaker will actually edit their film to fit the flow of music rather than have the composer edit his score to the final cut director godfrey reggio edited his films koyaanisqatsi and powaqqatsi based on composer philip glass s music similarly the relationship between director sergio leone and composer ennio morricone was such that the finale of the good the bad and the ugly and the films once upon a time in the west and once upon a time in america were edited to morricones score as the composer had prepared it months before the films production ended in another notable example the finale of steven spielberg s e t the extra-terrestrial was edited to match the music of his long-time collaborator john williams as recounted in a companion documentary on the dvd spielberg gave williams complete freedom with the music and asked him to record the cue without picture spielberg then re-edited the scene later to match the music in some circumstances a composer will be asked to write music based on his or her impressions of the script or storyboards without seeing the film itself and is given more freedom to create music without the need to adhere to specific cue lengths or mirror the emotional arc of a particular scene this approach is usually taken by a director who does not wish to have the music comment specifically on a particular scene or nuance of a film and which can instead be inserted into the film at any point the director wishes during the post-production process composer hans zimmer was asked to write music in this way in 2010 for director christopher nolan s film inception composer gustavo santaolalla did the same thing when he wrote his oscar-winning score for brokeback mountain syncing edit when writing music for film one goal is to sync dramatic events happening on screen with musical events in the score there are many different methods for syncing music to picture these include using sequencing software to calculate timings using mathematic formulas and free timing with reference timings composers work using smpte timecode for syncing purposes when syncing music to picture generally a leeway of 3 4 frames late or early allows the composer to be extremely accurate using a technique called free timing a conductor will use either a a stopwatch or studio size stop clock or b watch the film on a screen or video monitor while conducting the musicians to predetermined timings these are represented visually by vertical lines streamers and bursts of light called punches these are put on the film by the music editor at points specified by the composer in both instances the timings on the clock or lines scribed on the film have corresponding timings which are also at specific points beats in the composer conductor score written click track edit a written click track is a method of writing bars of music in consistent time values i e 4 beats in 02 seconds to establish a constant tempo in lieu of a metronome value e g 88 bpm a composer would use a written click if they planned to conduct live performers when using other methods such as a metronome the conductor has a perfectly spaced click playing in his ear which he conducts to this can yield stiff and lifeless performances in slower more expressive cues one can convert a standard bpm value to a written click where x represents the number of beats per bar and w represents time in seconds by using the following equation written clicks are expressed using 1 3 second increments so the next step is to round the decimal to either 0 13 or 2 3 of a second the following is an example for 88 bpm 2.72 rounds to 266 so the written click is 4 beats in 02 seconds once the composer has identified the location in the film they wish to sync with musically they must determine the musical beat this event occurs on to find this they use the following equation where bpm is beats per minute sp is the sync point in real-time i e 33.7 seconds and b is the beat number in 1 3 increments i e 49 writing edit once the spotting session has been completed and the precise timings of each cue determined the composer will then work on writing the score the methods of writing the score vary from composer to composer some composers prefer to work with a traditional pencil and paper writing notes by hand on a staff and performing works-in-progress for the director on a piano while other composers write on computers using sophisticated music composition software such as digital performer logic pro finale cubase or protools working with software allows composers to create midi-based demos of cues called midi mockups for review by the filmmaker prior to the final orchestral recording the length of time a composer has to write the score varies from project to project depending on the post-production schedule a composer may have as little as two weeks or as much as three months to write the score in normal circumstances the actual writing process usually lasts around six weeks from beginning to end maestro ilaiyaraaja is known to have completed most of his film scores within a week including spotting syncing writing and recording on many occasions he has scored for around 55 movies a year and has written scores for more than a 1000 films in various indian languages and one in english the actual musical content of a film score is wholly dependent on the type of film being scored and the emotions the director wishes the music to convey a film score can encompass literally thousands of different combinations of instruments ranging from full symphony orchestral ensembles to single solo instruments to rock bands to jazz combos along with a multitude of ethnic and world music influences soloists vocalists choirs and electronic textures the style of the music being written also varies massively from project to project and can be influenced by the time period in which the film is set the geographic location of the films action and even the musical tastes of the characters as part of their preparations for writing the score the composer will often research different musical techniques and genres as appropriate for that specific project as such it is not uncommon for established film composers to be proficient at writing music in dozens of different styles orchestration edit once the music has been written it must then be arranged or orchestrated in order for the ensemble to be able to perform it the nature and level of orchestration varies from project to project and composer to composer but in its basic form the orchestrators job is to take the single-line music written by the composer and flesh it out into instrument-specific sheet music for each member of the orchestra to perform some composers notably ennio morricone orchestrate their own scores themselves without using an additional orchestrator some composers provide intricate details in how they want this to be accomplished and will provide the orchestrator with copious notes outlining which instruments are being asked to perform which notes giving the orchestrator no personal creative input whatsoever beyond re-notating the music on different sheets of paper as appropriate other composers are less detailed and will often ask orchestrators to fill in the blanks providing their own creative input into the makeup of the ensemble ensuring that each instrument is capable of performing the music as written and even allowing them to introduce performance techniques and flourishes to enhance the score in many cases time constraints determined by the films post-production schedule dictate whether composers orchestrate their own scores as it is often impossible for the composer to complete all the required tasks within the timeframe allowed over the years several orchestrators have become linked to the work of one particular composer often to the point where one will not work without the other examples of enduring composer-orchestrator relationships include jerry goldsmith with arthur morton and alexander courage john williams with herbert w spencer alan menken with danny troob and michael starobin carter burwell with sonny kompanek graeme revell and michael giacchino with tim simonec alan silvestri with james b campbell and william ross miklós rózsa with eugene zador alfred newman with edward powell ken darby and hugo friedhofer danny elfman with steve bartek mark isham with ken kulger david arnold with nicholas dodd randy edelman with ralph ferraro and stuart balcomb basil poledouris with greig mcritchie and elliot goldenthal with robert elhai others have become orchestrators-for-hire and work with many different composers over the course of their careers examples of prominent film music orchestrators include pete anthony jeff atmajian brad dechter bruce fowler john neufeld thomas pasatieri conrad pope nic raine and j a c redford once the orchestration process has been completed the sheet music is physically printed onto paper by one or more music copyists and is ready for performance recording edit when the music has been composed and orchestrated the orchestra or ensemble then performs it often with the composer conducting musicians for these ensembles are often uncredited in the film or on the album and are contracted individually and if so the orchestra contractor is credited in the film or the soundtrack album however some films have recently begun crediting the contracted musicians on the albums under the name hollywood studio symphony after an agreement with the american federation of musicians other performing ensembles that are often employed include the london symphony orchestra performing film music since 1935 the city of prague philharmonic orchestra an orchestra dedicated mostly to recording the bbc philharmonic and the northwest sinfonia the orchestra performs in front of a large screen depicting the film the conductor and musicians habitually wear headphones that sound a series of clicks called a click-track that changes with meter and tempo assisting to synchronize the music with the film more rarely the director will talk to the composer before shooting has started so as to give more time to the composer or because the director needs to shoot scenes namely song or dance scenes according to the final score sometimes the director will have edited the film using temp temporary music already published pieces with a character that the director believes to fit specific scenes elements of a film score edit temp tracks edit in some instances film composers have been asked by the director to imitate a specific composer or style present in the temp track on other occasions directors have become so attached to the temp score that they decide to use it and reject the original score written by the film composer one of the most famous cases is stanley kubrick s 2001 a space odyssey where kubrick opted for existing recordings of classical works including pieces by composer györgy ligeti rather than the score by alex north although kubrick had also hired frank cordell to do a score other examples include torn curtain bernard herrmann troy gabriel yared pirates of the caribbean the curse of the black pearl klaus badelt peter jacksons king kong howard shore and the bourne identity carter burwell structure edit films often have different themes for important characters events ideas or objects an idea often associated with wagner s use of leitmotif these may be played in different variations depending on the situation they represent scattered amongst incidental music an example of this technique is john williams score for the star wars saga and the numerous themes associated with darth vader luke skywalker and princess leia see star wars music for more details music of the lord of the rings film series uses a similar technique with recurring themes for many main characters and places others are less known by casual moviegoers but well known among score enthusiasts such as jerry goldsmiths underlying theme for the borg in star trek first contact or his klingon theme from star trek the motion picture which other composers carry over into their klingon motifs and he has brought back on numerous occasions as the theme for worf star trek the next generation s most prominent klingon michael giacchino employed character themes in the soundtrack for the 2009 animated film up for which he received the academy award for best score his orchestral soundtrack for the television series lost also depended heavily on character and situation-specific themes in 1983 a non-profit organization the society for the preservation of film music was formed to preserve the byproducts of creating a film score the music manuscripts written music and other documents and studio recordings generated in the process of composing and recording scores which in some instances have been discarded by the movie studios the written music must be kept to perform the music on concert programs and to make new recordings of it sometimes only after decades has an archival recording of a film score been released on cd source music edit most films have between 40 and 120 minutes of music however some films have very little or no music others may feature a score that plays almost continuously throughout dogme 95 is a genre that has music only from sources within a film such as from a radio or television this is called source music or a source cue because it comes from an on screen source that can actually be seen or that can be inferred in academic film theory such music is called diegetic music as it emanates from the diegesis or story world an example of source music is the use of the frankie valli song cant take my eyes off you in michael cimino s the deer hunter alfred hitchcock s 1963 thriller the birds is an example of a hollywood film with no non-diegetic music whatsoever artistic merit edit the artistic merits of film music are frequently debated some critics value it highly pointing to music such as that written by erich wolfgang korngold aaron copland bernard herrmann and others some consider film music to be a defining genre of classical music in the late 20th century if only because it is the brand of classical music heard more often than any other in some cases film themes have become accepted into the canon of classical music these are mostly works from already noted composers who have done scores for instance sergei prokofiev s score to alexander nevsky or vaughan williams score to scott of the antarctic others see the great bulk of film music as meritless they consider that much film music is derivative borrowing heavily from previous works composers of film scores typically can produce about three or four per year the most popular works by composers such as john williams and danny elfman are still far from entering the accepted canon even so considering they are often the most popular modern compositions of classical music known to the general public major orchestras sometimes perform concerts of such music as do pops orchestras history edit according to kurt london film music began not as a result of any artistic urge but from a dire need of something which would drown the noise made by the projector for in those times there was as yet no sound-absorbent walls between the projection machine and the auditorium this painful noise disturbed visual enjoyment to no small extent instinctively cinema proprietors had recourse to music and it was the right way using an agreeable sound to neutralize one less agreeable before the age of recorded sound in motion pictures efforts were taken to provide suitable music for films usually through the services of an in-house pianist or organist and in some cases entire orchestras typically given cue sheets as a guide a pianist was present to perform at the lumiere brothers first film screening in 1895 in 1914 the oz film manufacturing company sent full-length scores by louis f gottschalk for their films other examples of this include victor herbert s score in 1915 to the fall of a nation a sequel to the birth of a nation and camille saint-saëns music for the assassination of the duke of guise in 1908 it was preceded by nathaniel d mann s score for the fairylogue and radio-plays by four months but that was a mixture of interrelated stage and film performance in the tradition of old magic lantern shows most accompaniments at this time these examples notwithstanding comprised pieces by famous composers also including studies these were often used to form catalogues of photoplay music which had different subsections broken down by mood and genre dark sad suspense action chase etc german cinema which was highly influential in the era of silent movies provided some original scores such as fritz lang s movies die nibelungen 1924 and metropolis 1927 which were accompanied by original full scale orchestral and leitmotific scores written by gottfried huppertz who also wrote piano-versions of his music for playing in smaller cinemas friedrich w murnaus movies nosferatu 1922 music by hans erdmann and faust eine deutsche volkssage 1926 music by werner richard heymann also had original scores written for them other films like murnaus der letzte mann contained a mixing of original compositions in this case by giuseppe becce and library music folk tunes which were artistically included into the score by the composer in france before the advent of talkies erik satie composed what many consider the first frame by frame synchronous film score for director rené clair s avant-garde short entracte 1924 anticipating spotting techniques and the inconsistencies of projection speeds in screenings of silent films satie took precise timings for each sequence and created a flexible aleatoric score of brief evocative motifs which could be repeated and varied in tempo as required american composers virgil thomson and aaron copland cited saties music for entracte as a major influence on their own forays into film scoring when sound came to movies director fritz lang barely used music in his movies anymore apart from peter lorre whistling a short piece from edvard griegs peer gynt langs movie m eine stadt sucht einen mörder was lacking musical accompaniment completely and das testament des dr mabuse only included one original piece written for the movie by hans erdmann played at the very beginning and end of the movie one of the rare occasions on which music occurs in the movie is a song one of the characters sings that lang uses to put emphasis on the mans insanity similar to the use of the whistling in m a landmark event in music synchronization with the action in film was achieved in the score composed by max steiner for david o selznicks 1933 king kong a fine example of this is when the aborigine chief slowly approaches the unwanted visitors to skull island who are filming the natives sacred rites as he strides closer and closer each footfall is reinforced by a background chord though the scoring of narrative features during the 1940s lagged decades behind technical innovations in the field of concert music the 1950s saw the rise of the modernist film score director elia kazan was open to the idea of jazz influences and dissonant scoring and worked with alex north whose score for a streetcar named desire 1951 combined dissonance with elements of blues and jazz kazan also approached leonard bernstein to score on the waterfront 1954 and the result was reminiscent of earlier works by aaron copland and igor stravinsky with its jazz-based harmonies and exciting additive rhythms a year later leonard rosenman inspired by arnold schoenberg experimented with atonality in his scores for east of eden 1955 and rebel without a cause 1955 in his ten-year collaboration with alfred hitchcock bernard herrmann experimented with ideas in vertigo 1958 and psycho 1960 the use of non-diegetic jazz was another modernist innovation such as jazz star duke ellington s score for otto preminger s anatomy of a murder 1959 composer edit academy award nominees and winners edit the following list includes all composers who have been nominated for an academy

list of film director and composer collaborations sometimes a composer may unite with a director by composing the score for many films of a same director for example danny elfman did the score for all the movies directed by tim burton with the exception of ed wood score by howard shore and sweeney todd the demon barber of fleet street score by stephen sondheim other examples are john williams with steven spielberg jerry goldsmith with joe dante and franklin schaffner ennio morricone with sergio leone mauro bolognini with giuseppe tornatore alan silvestri with robert zemeckis angelo badalamenti

production music edit main article production music many companies such as jingle punks associated production music firstcom music videohelper and extreme music provide music to various film tv and commercial projects for a fee sometimes called library music the music is owned by production music libraries and licensed to customers for use in film television radio and other media unlike popular and classical music publishers who typically own less than 50 percent of the copyright in a composition music production libraries own all of the copyrights of their music meaning that it can be licensed without seeking the composers permission as is necessary in licensing music from normal publishers this is because virtually all music created for music libraries is done on a work for hire basis production music is therefore a very convenient medium for media producers they can be assured that they will be able to license any piece of music in the library at a reasonable rate production music libraries will typically offer a broad range of musical styles and genres enabling producers and editors to find much of what they need in the same library music libraries vary in size from a few hundred tracks up to many thousands the first production music library was set up by de wolfe in 1927 with the advent of sound in film the company originally scored music for use in silent film another music library was set up by ralph hawkes of boosey hawkes music publishers in the 1930s apm the largest us library has over 250,000 tracks

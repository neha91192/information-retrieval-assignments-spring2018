imagination wikipedia for other uses see imagination disambiguation olin levi warner imagination 1896 library of congress thomas jefferson building washington d c imagination also called the faculty of imagining is the creative ability to form images ideas and sensations in the mind without any immediate input of the senses such as seeing or hearing imagination helps make knowledge applicable in solving problems and is fundamental to integrating experience and the learning process a basic training for imagination is listening to storytelling narrative in which the exactness of the chosen words is the fundamental factor to evoke worlds imagination is a cognitive process used in mental functioning and sometimes used in conjunction with psychological imagery the cognate term of mental imagery may be used in psychology for denoting the process of reviving in the mind recollections of objects formerly given in sense perception since this use of the term conflicts with that of ordinary language some psychologists have preferred to describe this process as imaging or imagery or to speak of it as reproductive as opposed to productive or constructive imagination constructive imagination is further divided into voluntary top-down imagination driven by the prefrontal cortex that is called mental synthesis and spontaneous bottom up involuntary generation of novel images that occurs during dreaming imagined images both novel and recalled are seen with the minds eye imagination can also be expressed through stories such as fairy tales or fantasies children often use such narratives and pretend play in order to exercise their imaginations when children develop fantasy they play at two levels first they use role playing to act out what they have developed with their imagination and at the second level they play again with their make-believe situation by acting as if what they have developed is an actual reality the minds eye edit the notion of a minds eye goes back at least to cicero s reference to mentis oculi during his discussion of the orators appropriate use of simile in this discussion cicero observed that allusions to the syrtis of his patrimony and the charybdis of his possessions involved similes that were too far-fetched and he advised the orator to instead just speak of the rock and the gulf respectively on the grounds that the eyes of the mind are more easily directed to those objects which we have seen than to those which we have only heard the concept of the minds eye first appeared in english in chaucers c 1387 man of laws tale in his canterbury tales where he tells us that one of the three men dwelling in a castle was blind and could only see with the eyes of his mind namely those eyes with which all men see after they have become blind description edit the common use of the term is for the process of forming new images in the mind that have not been previously experienced with the help of what has been seen heard or felt before or at least only partially or in different combinations some typical examples follow fairy tale fiction a form of verisimilitude often invoked in fantasy and science fiction invites readers to pretend such stories are true by referring to objects of the mind such as fictional books or years that do not exist apart from an imaginary world imagination not being limited to the acquisition of exact knowledge by the requirements of practical necessity is largely free from objective restraints the ability to imagine ones self in another persons place is very important to social relations and understanding albert einstein said imagination is more important than knowledge knowledge is limited imagination encircles the world the same limitations beset imagination in the field of scientific hypothesis progress in scientific research is due largely to provisional explanations which are developed by imagination but such hypotheses must be framed in relation to previously ascertained facts and in accordance with the principles of the particular science imagination is an experimental partition of the mind used to develop theories and ideas based on functions taking objects from real perceptions the imagination uses complex if-functions to develop new or revised ideas this part of the mind is vital to developing better and easier ways to accomplish old and new tasks in sociology imagination is used to part ways with reality and have an understanding of social interactions derived from a perspective outside of society itself this leads to the development of theories through questions that wouldnt usually be asked these experimental ideas can be safely conducted inside a virtual world and then if the idea is probable and the function is true the idea can be actualized in reality imagination is the key to new development of the mind and can be shared with others progressing collectively regarding the volunteer effort imagination can be classified as voluntary the dream from the sleep the daydream involuntary the reproductive imagination the creative imagination the dream of perspective psychology edit psychologists have studied imaginative thought not only in its exotic form of creativity and artistic expression but also in its mundane form of everyday imagination ruth m j byrne has proposed that everyday imaginative thoughts about counterfactual alternatives to reality may be based on the same cognitive processes on which rational thoughts are also based children can engage in the creation of imaginative alternatives to reality from their very early years cultural psychology is currently elaborating a view of imagination as a higher mental function involved in a number of everyday activities both at the individual and collective level that enables people to manipulate complex meanings of both linguistic and iconic forms in the process of experiencing the phenomenology of imagination is discussed in the imaginary a phenomenological psychology of the imagination french limaginaire psychologie phénoménologique de limagination also published under the title the psychology of the imagination is a 1940 book by jean-paul sartre in which he propounds his concept of the imagination and discusses what the existence of imagination shows about the nature of human consciousness the imagination is also active in our perception of photographic images in order to make them appear real memory edit see also mental image and imagery memory and mental imagery often seen as a part of the process of imagination have been shown to be affected by one another images made by functional magnetic resonance imaging technology show that remembering and imagining sends blood to identical parts of the brain various psuchologicfal factors and influence the mental processing of and can heighten the chance of the brain to retain information as either long-term memories or short-term memories john sweller indicated that experiences stored as long-term memories are easier to recall as they are ingrained deeper in the mind each of these forms require information to be taught in a specific manner so as to use various regions of the brain when being processed this information can potentially help develop programs for young students to cultivate or further enhance their creative abilities from a young age the neocortex and thalamus are responsible for controlling the brains imagination along with many of the brains other functions such as consciousness and abstract thought since imagination involves many different brain functions such as emotions memory thoughts etc portions of the brain where multiple functions occur—such as the thalamus and neocortex—are the main regions where imaginative processing has been documented the understanding of how memory and imagination are linked in the brain paves the way to better understand ones ability to link significant past experiences with their imagination perception edit piaget posited that perceptions depend on the world view of a person the world view is the result of arranging perceptions into existing imagery by imagination piaget cites the example of a child saying that the moon is following her when she walks around the village at night like this perceptions are integrated into the world view to make sense imagination is needed to make sense of perceptions versus belief edit imagination is different from belief because the subject understands that what is personally invented by the mind does not necessarily affect the course of action taken in the apparently shared world while beliefs are part of what one holds as truths about both the shared and personal worlds the play of imagination apart from the obvious limitations e g of avoiding explicit self-contradiction is conditioned only by the general trend of the mind at a given moment belief on the other hand is immediately related to practical activity it is perfectly possible to imagine oneself a millionaire but unless one believes it one does not therefore act as such belief endeavors to conform to the subjects experienced conditions or faith in the possibility of those conditions whereas imagination as such is specifically free the dividing line between imagination and belief varies widely in different stages of technological development thus in more extreme cases someone from a primitive culture who ill frames an ideal reconstruction of the causes of his illness and attributes it to the hostile magic of an enemy based on faith and tradition rather than science in ignorance of the science of pathology the subject is satisfied with this explanation and actually believes in it sometimes to the point of death due to what is known as the nocebo effect it follows that the learned distinction between imagination and belief depends in practice on religion tradition and culture brain activation edit a study using fmri while subjects were asked to imagine precise visual figures to mentally disassemble them or mentally blend them showed activity in the occipital frontoparietal posterior parietal precuneus and dorsolateral prefrontal regions of the subjects brains as a reality edit the world as experienced is an interpretation of data arriving from the senses as such it is perceived as real by contrast to most thoughts and imaginings users of hallucinogenic drugs are said to have a heightened imagination this difference is only one of degree and can be altered by several historic causes namely changes to brain chemistry hypnosis or other altered states of consciousness meditation many hallucinogenic drugs and electricity applied directly to specific parts of the brain the difference between imagined and perceived reality can be proven by psychosis many mental illnesses can be attributed to this inability to distinguish between the sensed and the internally created worlds some cultures and traditions even view the apparently shared world as an illusion of the mind as with the buddhist maya or go to the opposite extreme and accept the imagined and dreamed realms as of equal validity to the apparently shared world as the australian aborigines do with their concept of dreamtime imagination because of having freedom from external limitations can often become a source of real pleasure and unnecessary suffering consistent with this idea imagining pleasurable and fearful events is found to engage emotional circuits involved in emotional perception and experience a person of vivid imagination often suffers acutely from the imagined perils besetting friends relatives or even strangers such as celebrities also crippling fear can result from taking an imagined painful future too seriously

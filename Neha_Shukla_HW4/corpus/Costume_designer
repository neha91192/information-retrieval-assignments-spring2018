the theatre they design for a freelancer is traditionally paid in three instalments upon hire on delivery of final renderings and opening night of the production freelancers are not obligated to any exclusivity in what projects they work on and may design for several productions concurrently a residential designer is hired by a specific theatre dance or opera company for an extended series of productions this can be as short as a summer stock contract or may be for many years a residential designers contract may limit the amounts of freelance work they are allowed to accept unlike the freelancer a residential designer is consistently on location at the theater—at hand to work with costume studio and other collaborators residential designers tend to be more established than strict freelancers but this is not always the case an academic designer is one who holds professorship at a school the designer is primarily an instructor but may also act as a residential designer to varying degrees they are often free to freelance as their schedule allows in the past professors of costume design were mostly experienced professionals that may or may not have had formal post-graduate education but it has now become increasingly common to require a professor to have at least a master of fine arts in order to teach both residential and academic designers are generally also required to act as shop master or mistress of an onsite costume shop in addition to designing productions in a resident theatre there is almost always a shop staff of stitchers drapers cutters and craft artisans in an academic environment the shop staff is generally students who are learning about costume design and construction most universities require costume design students to work a specified number of hours in the shop as part of their course work unions edit there are two unions that costume designers can belong to costume designers guild local 892 is one union that represents

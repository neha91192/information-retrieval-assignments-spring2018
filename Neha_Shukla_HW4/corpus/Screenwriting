screenwriting wikipedia screenwriting also called scriptwriting is the art and craft of writing scripts for mass media such as feature films television productions or video games it is frequently a freelance profession screenwriters are responsible for researching the story developing the narrative writing the screenplay and delivering it in the required format to development executives screenwriters therefore have great influence over the creative direction and emotional impact of the screenplay and arguably of the finished film screenwriters either pitch original ideas to producers in the hope that they will be optioned or sold or are commissioned by a producer to create a screenplay from a concept true story existing screen work or literary work such as a novel poem play comic book or short story types edit the act of screenwriting takes many forms across the entertainment industry often multiple writers work on the same script at different stages of development with different tasks over the course of a successful career a screenwriter might be hired to write in a wide variety of roles some of the most common forms of screenwriting jobs include spec script writing edit spec scripts are feature film or television show scripts written on speculation of sale without the commission of a film studio production company or tv network the content is usually invented solely by the screenwriter though spec screenplays can also be based on established works or real people and events the spec script is a hollywood sales tool the vast majority of scripts written each year are spec scripts but only a small percentage make it to the screen a spec script is usually a wholly original work but can also be an adaptation in television writing a spec script is a sample teleplay written to demonstrate the writers knowledge of a show and ability to imitate its style and conventions it is submitted to the shows producers in hopes of being hired to write future episodes of the show budding screenwriters attempting to break into the business generally begin by writing one or more spec scripts although writing spec scripts is part of any writers career the writers guild of america forbids members to write on speculation the distinction is that a spec script is written as a sample by the writer on his or her own what is forbidden is writing a script for a specific producer without a contract in addition to writing a script on speculation it is generally not advised to write camera angles or other directional terminology as these are likely to be ignored a director may write up a shooting script himself or herself a script that guides the team in what to do in order to carry out the directors vision of how the script should look the director may ask the original writer to co-write it with him or her or to rewrite a script that satisfies both the director and producer of the film tv show spec writing is also unique in that the writer must pitch the idea to producers in order to sell the script it must have a killer title good writing and a great logline a logline is one sentence that lays out what the movie is about a well written logline will convey the tone of the film introduce the main character and touch on the primary conflict usually the logline and title work in tandem to draw people in and it is highly suggested to incorporate irony into them when possible these things along with nice clean writing will hugely impact whether or not a producer picks up the spec script commissioned screenplay edit a commissioned screenplay is written by a hired writer the concept is usually developed long before the screenwriter is brought on and often has multiple writers work on it before the script is given a green light feature assignment writing edit scripts written on assignment are screenplays created under contract with a studio production company or producer these are the most common assignments sought after in screenwriting a screenwriter can get an assignment either exclusively or from open assignments a screenwriter can also be approached and offered an assignment assignment scripts are generally adaptations of an existing idea or property owned by the hiring company but can also be original works based on a concept created by the writer or producer rewriting and script doctoring edit most produced films are rewritten to some extent during the development process frequently they are not rewritten by the original writer of the script many established screenwriters as well as new writers whose work shows promise but lacks marketability make their living rewriting scripts when a scripts central premise or characters are good but the script is otherwise unusable a different writer or team of writers is contracted to do an entirely new draft often referred to as a page one rewrite when only small problems remain such as bad dialogue or poor humor a writer is hired to do a polish or punch-up depending on the size of the new writers contributions screen credit may or may not be given for instance in the american film industry credit to rewriters is given only if 50% or more of the script is substantially changed these standards can make it difficult to establish the identity and number of screenwriters who contributed to a films creation when established writers are called in to rewrite portions of a script late in the development process they are commonly referred to as script doctors prominent script doctors include christopher keane steve zaillian william goldman robert towne mort nathan quentin tarantino and peter russell many up-and-coming screenwriters work as ghost writers television writing edit a freelance television writer typically uses spec scripts or previous credits and reputation to obtain a contract to write one or more episodes for an existing television show after an episode is submitted rewriting or polishing may be required a staff writer for a tv show generally works in-house writing and rewriting episodes staff writers—often given other titles such as story editor or producer —work both as a group and individually on episode scripts to maintain the shows tone style characters and plots television show creators write the television pilot and bible of new television series they are responsible for creating and managing all aspects of a shows characters style and plots frequently a creator remains responsible for the shows day-to-day creative decisions throughout the series run as show runner head writer or story editor writing for daily series edit the process of writing for soap operas and telenovelas is different from that used by prime time shows due in part to the need to produce new episodes five days a week for several months in one example cited by jane espenson screenwriting is a sort of three-tiered system a few top writers craft the overall story arcs mid-level writers work with them to turn those arcs into things that look a lot like traditional episode outlines and an array of writers below that who do not even have to be local to los angeles take those outlines and quickly generate the dialogue while adhering slavishly to the outlines espenson notes that a recent trend has been to eliminate the role of the mid-level writer relying on the senior writers to do rough outlines and giving the other writers a bit more freedom regardless when the finished scripts are sent to the top writers the latter do a final round of rewrites espenson also notes that a show that airs daily with characters who have decades of history behind their voices necessitates a writing staff without the distinctive voice that can sometimes be present in prime-time series writing for game shows edit game shows feature live contestants but still use a team of writers as part of a specific format this may involve the slate of questions and even specific phrasing or dialogue on the part of the host writers may not script the dialogue used by the contestants but they work with the producers to create the actions scenarios and sequence of events that support the game shows concept video game writing edit with the continued development and increased complexity of video games many opportunities are available to employ screenwriters in the field of video game design video game writers work closely with the other game designers to create characters scenarios and dialogue theories on writing a screenplay edit fundamentally the screenplay is a unique literary form it is like a musical score in that it is intended to be interpreted on the basis of other artists performance rather than serving as a finished product for the enjoyment of its audience for this reason a screenplay is written using technical jargon and tight spare prose when describing stage directions unlike a novel or short story a screenplay focuses on describing the literal visual aspects of the story rather than on the internal thoughts of its characters in screenwriting the aim is to evoke those thoughts and emotions through subtext action and symbolism several main screenwriting theories help writers approach the screenplay by systematizing the structure goals and techniques of writing a script the most common kinds of theories are structural screenwriter william goldman is widely quoted as saying screenplays are structure three-act structure edit main article three-act structure the three acts are setup of the location and characters confrontation with an obstacle and resolution culminating in a climax and a dénouement usually in a two-hour film the first and third acts both typically last around 30 minutes with the middle act lasting roughly an hour but today many films start from the confrontation point and then goes to the setup act or they might even start at the last act and then go back to the start in writing drama french writer and director yves lavandier shows a slightly different approach as do most theorists he maintains that every human action whether fictitious or real contains three logical parts before the action during the action and after the action but since the climax is part of the action yves lavandier maintains that the second act must include the climax which makes for a much shorter third act than is found in most screenwriting theories besides the three-act structure it is also common to use a four- or five-act structure in a screenplay though certain screenplays may include as many as twenty separate acts the heros journey edit the heros journey also referred to as the monomyth is an idea formulated by noted mythologist joseph campbell the central concept of the monomyth is that a pattern can be seen in stories and myths across history campbell defined and explained that pattern in his book the hero with a thousand faces 1949 campbells insight was that important myths from around the world which have survived for thousands of years all share a fundamental structure this fundamental structure contains a number of stages which include a call to adventure which the hero has to accept or decline a road of trials on which the hero succeeds or fails achieving the goal or boon which often results in important self-knowledge a return to the ordinary world which again the hero can succeed or fail and application of the boon in which what the hero has gained can be used to improve the world later screenwriter christopher vogler refined and expanded the heros journey for the screenplay form in his book the writers journey mythic structure for writers 1993 syd fields paradigm edit in his book screenplay syd field posited a new theory which he called the paradigm field noticed that in a 120-page screenplay act two was notoriously boring and was also twice the length of acts one and three he also noticed that an important dramatic event usually occurred at the middle of the picture which implied to him that the middle act was actually two acts in one so the three act structure is notated 1 2a 2b 3 resulting in aristotle s three acts divided into four pieces field also introduced the idea of plot points into screenwriting theory plot points are important structural functions that happen in approximately the same place in most successful movies like the verses and choruses in a popular song in subsequent books field has added to his original list and students of his like viki king and linda seger have added to the list of plot points here is a current list of the major plot points that are congruent with fields paradigm opening image the first image in the screenplay should summarize the entire film especially its tone often writers go back and redo this as the last thing before submitting the script exposition provides some background information to the audience about the plot characters histories setting and theme inciting incident also called the catalyst this is the point in the story when the protagonist encounters the problem that will change their life this is when the detective is assigned the case where boy meets girl and where the comic hero gets fired from his cushy job forcing him into comic circumstances plot point 1 the last scene in act one plot point 1 is a surprising development that radically changes the protagonists life and forces him to confront the opponent in star wars this is when luke s family is killed by the empire he has no home to go back to so he joins the rebels in opposing darth vader pinch 1 a reminder scene at about 3 8 the way through the script halfway through act 2a that brings up the central conflict of the drama reminding us of the overall conflict for example in star wars pinch 1 is the stormtroopers attacking the millennium falcon in mos eisley reminding us the empire is after the stolen plans to the death star r2-d2 is carrying and luke and ben kenobi are trying to get to the rebel alliance the main conflict midpoint an important scene in the middle of the script often a reversal of fortune or revelation that changes the direction of the story field suggests that driving the story towards the midpoint keeps the second act from sagging pinch 2 another reminder scene about 5 8 through the script halfway through act 2b that is somehow linked to pinch 1 in reminding the audience about the central conflict in star wars pinch 2 is the stormtroopers attacking them as they rescue the princess in the death star both scenes remind us of the empires opposition and using the stormtrooper attack motif unifies both pinches plot point 2 a dramatic reversal that ends act 2 and begins act 3 which is about confrontation and resolution sometimes plot point 2 is the moment when the hero has had enough and is finally going to face the opponent sometimes like in toy story its the low-point for the hero and he must bounce back to overcome the odds in act 3 showdown about midway through act 3 the protagonist will confront the main problem of the story and either overcome it or come to a tragic end resolution the issues of the story are resolved tag an epilogue tying up the loose ends of the story giving the audience closure this is also known as denouement in general films in recent decades have had longer denouements than films made in the 1970s or earlier the sequence approach edit the sequence approach to screenwriting sometimes known as eight-sequence structure is a system developed by frank daniel while he was the head of the graduate screenwriting program at usc it is based in part on the fact that in the early days of cinema technical matters forced screenwriters to divide their stories into sequences each the length of a reel about ten minutes the sequence approach mimics that early style the story is broken up into eight 10 15 minute sequences the sequences serve as mini-movies each with their own compressed three-act structure the first two sequences combine to form the films first act the next four create the films second act the final two sequences complete the resolution and dénouement of the story each sequences resolution creates the situation which sets up the next sequence dialogue and description edit imagery edit imagery can be used in many metaphoric ways in the talented mr ripley the title character talked of wanting to close the door on himself sometime and then in the end he did pathetic fallacy is also frequently used rain to express a character feeling depressed sunny days promote a feeling of happiness and calm imagery can be used to sway the emotions of the audience and to clue them in to what is happening imagery is well defined in city of god the opening image sequence sets the tone for the entire film the film opens with the shimmer of a knifes blade on a sharpening stone a drink is being prepared the knifes blade shows again juxtaposed is a shot of a chicken letting loose of its harness on its feet all symbolising the one that got away the film is about life in the favelas in rio sprinkled with violence and games and ambition dialogue edit dialogue can be very important to the film industry because there are no written words to explain the characters or plot it all has to be explained through dialogue and imagery bollywood and other indian film industries use separate dialogue writers in addition to the screenplay writers plot edit see also act structure while the story is what will be told narrative the plot is how the story will be told narration this vocabulary is not indisputable for sometimes in literature stories and plots are used exactly the other way around screenwriting education edit a number of american universities offer specialized master of fine arts and undergraduate programs in screenwriting including usc depaul university american film institute loyola marymount university chapman university nyu ucla boston university and the university of the arts in europe the united kingdom has an extensive range of ma and ba screenwriting courses including london college of communication bournemouth university edinburgh university and goldsmiths college university of london some schools offer non-degree screenwriting programs such as the thefilmschool the international film and television school fast track and the ucla professional extension programs in screenwriting new york film academy offers both degree and non-degree educational systems with campuses all around the world many screenwriters choose to pursue screenwriting independently with free online educational resources such as screencraft keanewords nofilmschool film daily the black list john august and craig mazins scriptnotes podcast and julie grays just effing entertain me history edit the first true screenplay is thought to be from george melies 1902 film a trip to the moon the movie is silent but the screenplay still contains specific descriptions and action lines that resemble a modern-day script as time went on and films became longer and more complex the need for a screenplay became more prominent in the industry the introduction of movie theaters also impacted the development of screenplays as audiences became more widespread and sophisticated so the stories had to be as well once the first non-silent movie was released in 1927 screenwriting became a hugely important position within hollywood the studio system of the 1930s only heightened this importance as studio heads wanted productivity thus having the blueprint continuity screenplay of the film beforehand became extremely optimal around 1970 the spec script was first created and changed the industry for writers forever now screenwriting for television teleplays is considered as difficult and competitive as writing is for feature films portrayed in film edit screenwriting has been the focus of a number of films crashing hollywood 1931 —a screenwriter collaborates on a gangster movie with a real-life gangster when the film is released the mob doesn t like how accurate the movie is sunset boulevard 1950 —actor william holden portrays a hack screenwriter forced to collaborate on a screenplay with a

struggling to finish his screenplay seven psychopaths but finds unlikely inspiration after his best friend steals a shih tzu owned by a vicious gangster copyright protection edit united states edit in the united states completed works may be copyrighted but ideas and plots may not be any document written after 1978 in the u s is automatically copyrighted even without legal registration or notice however the library of congress will formally register a screenplay u s courts will not accept a lawsuit alleging that a defendant is infringing on the plaintiffs copyright in a work until the plaintiff registers the plaintiffs claim to those copyrights with the copyright office this means that a plaintiffs attempts to remedy an infringement will be delayed during the registration process additionally in many infringement cases the plaintiff will not be able recoup attorney fees or collect statutory damages for copyright infringement unless the plaintiff registered before the infringement began for the purpose of establishing evidence that a screenwriter is the author of a particular screenplay but not related to the legal copyrighting status of a work the writers guild of america registers screenplays however since this service is one of record keeping and is not regulated by law a variety of commercial and non-profit organizations exist for registering screenplays protection for teleplays formats as well as screenplays may be registered for instant proof-of-authorship by third-party assurance vendors such as the creators vault there is a line of precedent in several states including california and new york that allows for idea submission claims based on the notion that submission of a screenplay or even a mere pitch for one to a studio under very particular sets of factual circumstances could potentially give rise to an implied contract to pay for the ideas embedded in that screenplay even if an alleged derivative work does not actually infringe the screenplay authors copyright the unfortunate side effect of such precedents which were supposed to protect screenwriters is that it is now that much harder to break into screenwriting naturally motion picture and television production firms responded by categorically declining to read all unsolicited screenplays from unknown writers accepting screenplays only through official channels like talent agents managers and attorneys and forcing screenwriters to sign broad legal releases before their screenplays will be actually accepted read or considered in turn agents managers and attorneys have become extremely powerful gatekeepers on behalf of the major film studios and media networks one symptom of how hard it is to break into screenwriting as a result of such case law is that in 2008 universal studios resisted construction of a bike path along the los angeles river next to its studio lot because it would worsen their existing problem with desperate amateur screenwriters throwing copies of their work over the studio wall

businesses for occasional use a larger fare can be paid using a coin machine in the bus unit the interurban lines have differential fares and some allow payment in cash only the municipal administration is phasing out the paper cards in favor of the plastic ones during the second half of 2012 the urban bus fleet was partially renewed during the recovery of the national economy since 2003 and consists of about 730 units in 2005 the average age of the buses was 5 years and 11 months improvements in the economy have led to increased use of public transport and comparatively less use of bicycles according to the rosario transportation office in 2005 there were about 11 million bus journeys per month by 2007 usage has climbed to 420,000 people every day 12.6 million per month a significant number of buses run on natural gas as it happens also in argentina as a whole since the price of this fuel is quite low compared to the alternatives the idea to transform all buses to this system did not prosper most buses run on heavily subsidized diesel fuel in 2012 bus lanes were added to several pairs of parallel streets traversing the downtown area bus stops along these are spaced every three blocks instead of the usual two for the most part they leave room to only one additional narrow lane on the left for cars and other vehicles they can be used for taxis carrying passengers as well they are exclusive for public transport during weekdays and on saturday morning stopping or parking on the affected streets is forbidden as well as right turns their implementation attracted opposition from residents and shop owners but was well received by habitual bus users since they reduce the time needed to get out of the crowded central area by a noticeable amount rosario has a medium-sized taxi fleet with units painted black and outlined in yellow some belong to radio-taxi companies and can be reserved by telephone others only in the streets as the economy of argentina

edit rosario is the third largest urban center where rioplatense spanish is spoken after buenos aires and montevideo the local language evidences the typical linguistic features that characterize this dialect notably the voseo use of vos instead of tú as pronoun for the second person singular and the sheismo form of yeísmo where ll- and y- are pronounced as a voiceless ʃ although the español rosarino does not differ substantially from the other variants of the same dialect it presents particularities easily noticeable by those who live in the other main populated areas of the region one of the most notable characteristics of the language of rosarios area of influence is the process of aspiration and disappearance of the -s when the -s is in implosive position end of syllable or word followed by consonant its sound becomes a soft and voiceless aspiration h the word obispo is pronounced o̞ˈβihpo̞ in the popular and vulgar language the final -s -r or -d are sometimes suppressed although this phenomenon is commonly associated to sociocultural groups of lower formal education just as in buenos aires the voseo is pronominal and verbal the pronoun tú and its associated verbal forms are inexistent which is not the case of the montevideo variant the tendency to add a final -s to the verbal forms of the second person plural vos fuistes vos vinistes which is rather common in buenos aires is very unusual among rosario natives the intonation in rosario is generally more neutral and monotonous than that of buenos aires even though the lexicon of rosario and buenos aires is

different camera setup each line designates the start and stop of that setup a quick note of what the shot description was and whether or not the dialogue was on camera for that setup this allows the editor to quickly reference which camera setups cover which portion of the dialogue or action production reports at the end of each shooting day the script supervisor prepares daily reports for the production team these reports vary in form depending on the studio or production company however they generally include a log of the actual times that shooting and breaks started and stopped and a breakdown of the pages scenes and minutes that were shot that day as well as the same information for the previous day the total script and the amounts remaining to be done also included are the

rather than artistic position and is generally considered as part of the producers or studios staff there is usually only one script supervisor on a given film production earlier terms edit up until the late thirties and early forties the script supervisor in the american film and television industry was typically called the continuity clerk script reader or script girl and often there were 2 people doing the job one was the continuity clerk and one was the script girl individuals performing such duties were either credited with these titles or more often not credited at all during this span of time many script supervisors were indeed women a fact that originally spawned the title script girl however over the years script supervisor positions throughout the american motion picture industry became more thoroughly integrated and formed a better balance among men and women this fact coupled with producers desire to promote gender neutrality in a position that was increasingly taken up by men produced the gradual change in nomenclature by the fifties the gender-specific term had virtually disappeared from film and television credits but sometimes appeared in everyday speech

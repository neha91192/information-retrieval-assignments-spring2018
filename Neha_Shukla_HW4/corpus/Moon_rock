moon rock wikipedia for other uses see moonrock olivine basalt collected by the crew of apollo 15 moon rock or lunar rock is rock that is found on the earths moon or lunar material collected during the course of human exploration of the moon sources edit moon rocks on earth come from three sources those collected by the united states apollo program manned lunar landings from 1969 to 1972 samples returned by three soviet luna programme unmanned probes in the 1970s and rocks that were ejected naturally from the lunar surface by cratering events and subsequently fell to earth as lunar meteorites during the six apollo landing missions 2,415 samples were collected weighing 839.87 pounds 380.96 kg three luna spacecraft returned with 11.5 ounces 330 g of samples more than 300 lunar meteorites have been collected on earth representing more than 30 different meteorite fall events none witnessed with a total mass of over 419 pounds 190 kg some were discovered by scientific teams searching for meteorites in antarctica such as ansmet with most of the remainder discovered by collectors in the desert regions of northern africa and oman dating edit rocks from the moon have been measured by radiometric dating techniques they range in age from about 3.16 billion years old for the basaltic samples derived from the lunar maria up to about 4.44 billion years old for rocks derived from the highlands based on the age-dating technique of crater counting the youngest basaltic eruptions are believed to have occurred about 1.2 billion years ago but scientists do not possess samples of these lavas in contrast the oldest ages of rocks from the earth are between 3.8 and 4.28 billion years old composition edit main article geology of the moon moon rocks fall into two main categories those found in the lunar highlands terrae and those in the maria the terrae consist dominantly of mafic plutonic rocks regolith breccias with similar protoliths are also common mare basalts come in three distinct series in direct relation to their titanium content high-ti basalts low-ti basalts and very low-ti vlt basalts almost all lunar rocks are depleted in volatiles and are completely lacking in hydrated minerals common in earth rocks in some regards lunar rocks are closely related to earths rocks in their isotopic composition of the element oxygen the apollo moon rocks were collected using a variety of tools including hammers rakes scoops tongs and core tubes most were photographed prior to collection to record the condition in which they were found they were placed inside sample bags and then a special environmental sample container for return to the earth to protect them from contamination in contrast to the earth large portions of the lunar crust appear to be composed of rocks with high concentrations of the mineral anorthite the mare basalts have relatively high iron values furthermore some of the mare basalts have very high levels of titanium in the form of ilmenite unmanned sample returns edit the soviet union attempted but failed to make manned lunar landings in the 1970s due to failure to develop their n1 rocket but they succeeded in landing three robotic luna spacecraft with the capability to collect and return small samples to earth a combined total of less than one kilogram of material was returned in 1993 three small fragments from luna 16 weighing 200 mg were sold for us 442500 highlands rocks edit processing facility in lunar sample building at jsc slice of moon rock at the national air and space museum in washington dc primary igneous rocks in the lunar highlands compose three distinct groups the ferroan anorthosite suite the magnesian suite and the alkali suite lunar breccias formed largely by the immense basin-forming impacts are dominantly composed of highland lithologies because most mare basalts post-date basin formation and largely fill these impact basins the ferroan anorthosite suite consists almost exclusively of the rock anorthosite 90% calcic plagioclase with less common anorthositic gabbro 7080% calcic plagioclase with minor pyroxene the ferroan anorthosite suite is the most common group in the highlands and is inferred to represent plagioclase flotation cumulates of the lunar magma ocean with interstitial mafic phases formed from trapped interstitial melt or rafted upwards with the more abundant plagioclase framework the plagioclase is extremely calcic by terrestrial standards with molar anorthite contents of 9496% an94-96 this reflects the extreme depletion of the bulk moon in alkalis na k as well as water and other volatile elements in contrast the mafic minerals in this suite have low mg fe ratios that are inconsistent with calcic plagioclase compositions ferroan anorthosites have been dated using the internal isochron method at circa 4.4 ga the magnesian suite or mg suite consists of dunites 90% olivine troctolites olivine-plagioclase and gabbros plagioclase-pyroxene with relatively high mg fe ratios in the mafic minerals and a range of plagioclase compositions that are still generally calcic an86-93 these rocks represent later intrusions into the highlands crust ferroan anorthosite at round 4.34.1 ga an interesting aspect of this suite is that analysis of the trace element content of plagioclase and pyroxene require equilibrium with a kreep -rich magma despite the refractory major element contents the alkali suite is so-called because of its high alkali contentâ€”for moon rocks the alkali suite consists of alkali anorthosites with relatively sodic plagioclase an70-85 norites plagioclase-orthopyroxene and gabbronorites plagioclase-clinopyroxene-orthopyroxene with similar plagioclase compositions and mafic minerals more iron-rich than the magnesian suite the trace element contents of these minerals also indicates a kreep-rich parent magma the alkali suite spans an age range similar to the magnesian suite lunar granites are relatively rare rocks that include diorites monzodiorites and granophyres they consist of quartz plagioclase orthoclase or alkali feldspar rare mafics pyroxene and rare zircon the alkali feldspar may have unusual compositions unlike any terrestrial feldspar and they are often ba-rich these rocks apparently form by the extreme fractional crystallization of magnesian suite or alkali suite magmas although liquid immiscibility may also play a role u-pb date of zircons from these rocks and from lunar soils have ages of 4.14.4 ga more or less the same as the magnesian suite and alkali suite rocks in the 1960s nasa researcher john a okeefe and others linked lunar granites with tektites found on earth although many researchers refuted these claims according to one study a portion of lunar sample 12013 has a chemistry that closely resembles javanite tektites found on earth lunar breccias range from glassy vitrophyre melt rocks to glass-rich breccia to regolith breccias the vitrophyres are dominantly glassy rocks that represent impact melt sheets that fill large impact structures they contain few clasts of the target lithology which is largely melted by the impact glassy breccias form from impact melt that exit the crater and entrain large volumes of crushed but not melted ejecta it may contain abundant clasts that reflect the range of lithologies in the target region sitting in a matrix of mineral fragments plus glass that welds it all together some of the clasts in these breccias are pieces of older breccias documenting a repeated history of impact brecciation cooling and impact regolith breccias resemble the glassy breccias but have little or no glass melt to weld them together as noted above the basin-forming impacts responsible for these breccias pre-date almost all mare basalt volcanism so clasts of mare basalt are very rare when found these clasts represent the earliest phase of mare basalt volcanism preserved mare basalts edit mare basalts are named as such because they frequently constitute large portions of the lunar maria they are similar to terrestrial basalts but have many important differences for example mare basalts show a large negative europium anomaly certain mare basalts the so-called vhk very high k basalt s have extraordinary potassium content curation and availability edit genesis rock returned by the apollo 15 mission the main repository for the apollo moon rocks is the lunar sample laboratory facility at the lyndon b johnson space center in houston texas for safe keeping there is also a smaller collection stored at white sands test facility in las cruces new mexico most of the rocks are stored in nitrogen to keep them free of moisture they are handled only indirectly using special tools moon rocks collected during the course of lunar exploration are currently considered priceless in 2002 a safe was stolen from the lunar sample building that contained minute samples of lunar and martian material the samples were recovered and nasa estimated their value during the ensuing court case at about 1 million for 10 oz 285 g of material naturally transported moon rocks in the form of lunar meteorites are sold and traded among private collectors goodwill moon rocks edit main article lunar sample displays honduras plaque apollo 17 astronauts eugene cernan and harrison schmitt picked up a rock composed of many fragments of many sizes and many shapes probably from all parts of the moon this rock was later labeled sample 70017 president nixon ordered that fragments of that rock should be distributed in 1973 to all 50 us states and 135 foreign heads of state the fragments were presented encased in an acrylic sphere mounted on a wood plaque which included the recipients flag which had also flown aboard apollo 17 many of the presentation moon rocks are now unaccounted for having been stolen or lost discoveries edit three minerals were discovered from the moon these include armalcolite tranquillityite and pyroxferroite armalcolite was named for the three astronauts on the apollo 11 mission arm strong al drin and col lins stolen and missing moon rocks edit main article stolen and missing moon rocks because of their

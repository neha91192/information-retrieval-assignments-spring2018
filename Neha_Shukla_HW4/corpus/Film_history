history of film wikipedia this article is about the history of film as an artistic medium for the history of motion-picture technology see history of film technology cinématographe lumière at the institut lumière in lyon france although the start of the history of film is not clearly defined the commercial public screening of ten of lumière brothers short films in paris on 28 december 1895 can be regarded as the breakthrough of projected cinematographic motion pictures there had been earlier cinematographic results and screenings but these lacked either the quality or the momentum that propelled the cinématographe lumière into a worldwide success soon film production companies were established all over the world the first decade of motion picture saw film moving from a novelty to an established mass entertainment industry the earliest films were in black and white under a minute long and without recorded sound during the 1890s films became several minutes long and started to consist of several shots the first film studios were built in 1897 the first rotating camera for taking panning shots was built in 1898 special effects were introduced and film continuity involving action moving from one sequence into another began to be used in the 1900s continuity of action across successive shots was achieved and the first close-up shot was introduced that some claim d w griffith invented most films of this period were what came to be called chase films the first successful permanent theatre showing only films was the nickelodeon in pittsburgh in 1905 the first feature length multi-reel film was a 1906 australian production by 1910 actors began to receive screen credit for their roles and the way to the creation of film stars was opened regular newsreels were exhibited from 1910 and soon became a popular way for finding out the news from about 1910 american films had the largest share of the market in australia and in all european countries except france new film techniques were introduced in this period including the use of artificial lighting fire effects and low-key lighting i e lighting in which most of the frame is dark for enhanced atmosphere during sinister scenes as films grew longer specialist writers were employed to simplify more complex stories derived from novels or plays into a form that could be contained on one reel and be easier to be understood by the audience an audience that was new to this form of storytelling genres began to be used as categories the main division was into comedy and drama but these categories were further subdivided during the first world war there was a complex transition for the film industry the exhibition of films changed from short one-reel programs to feature films exhibition venues became larger and began charging higher prices by 1914 continuity cinema was the established mode of commercial cinema one of the advanced continuity techniques involved an accurate and smooth transition from one shot to another d w griffith had the highest standing among american directors in the industry because of the dramatic excitement he conveyed to the audience through his films the american film industry or hollywood as it was becoming known after its new geographical center in hollywood a neighborhood in los angeles california gained the position it has held more or less ever since film factory for the world and exporting its product to most countries by the 1920s the united states reached what is still its era of greatest-ever output producing an average of 800 feature films annually or 82% of the global total eyman 1997 during late 1927 warners released the jazz singer with the first synchronized dialogue and singing in a feature film by the end of 1929 hollywood was almost all-talkie with several competing sound systems soon to be standardized sound saved the hollywood studio system in the face of the great depression parkinson 1995 the desire for wartime propaganda created a renaissance in the film industry in britain with realistic war dramas the onset of american involvement in world war ii also brought a proliferation of films as both patriotism and propaganda the house un-american activities committee investigated hollywood in the early 1950s during the immediate post-war years the cinematic industry was also threatened by television and the increasing popularity of the medium meant that some film theatres would bankrupt and close the 1950s was a golden age for non-english world cinema roundhay garden scene is an 1888 short silent film recorded by french inventor louis le prince it is believed to be the oldest surviving film in existence as noted by the guinness book of records the film sortie de lusine lumière de lyon 1895 by french louis lumière is considered the first true motion picture precursors edit main article precursors of film much of film as an art form grew out of several earlier traditions in the fields of oral storytelling literature theatre and visual art examples of quite similar forms of art and entertainment that already featured moving and or projected images include shadowgraphy probably in practice since prehistoric times camera obscura a natural phenomenon that has possibly been used as an artistic aid since prehistoric times shadow puppetry possibly originated around 200 bce in central asia india indonesia or china magic lantern developed in the 1650s preceded by some incidental and or inferior projectors stroboscopic persistence of vision animation devices phénakisticope since 1832 zoetrope since 1866 flip book since 1868 some ancient sightings of gods and spirits are thought to have been conjured up by means of concave mirrors camera obscura or unknown projectors by the 16th century necromantic ceremonies and the conjuring of ghostly apparitions by charlatan magicians and witches seemed commonplace the very first magic lantern shows seem to have continued this tradition with images of death monsters and other scary figures around 1790 this was developed into multi-media ghost shows known as phantasmagoria that could feature mechanical slides rear projection mobile projectors superimposition dissolves live actors smoke sometimes to project images upon odors sounds and even electric shocks similar spooky subject matter would form the basis of the horror film genre that emerged very soon after the introduction of cinema moving images were possibly projected with the magic lantern since its invention christiaan huygens 1659 sketches for slides show a skeleton taking his skull off his neck and placing it back techniques to add motion to the painted glass slides were described since circa 1700 these usually involved parts for instance limbs painted on one or more extra pieces of glass moved by hand or small mechanisms across a stationary slide which showed the rest of the picture while the first magic lantern images seem to have been intended to scare audiences soon all sorts of subjects appeared and the lantern was not only used for storytelling but also for education in the 19th century several new and popular magic lantern techniques were developed including dissolving views and several types of mechanical slides that created dazzling abstract effects chromatrope et cetera or that showed for instance falling snow or the planets and their moons revolving early period edit main articles silent film and sound film interior view of kinetoscope with peephole viewer at top of cabinet in the 1890s films were seen mostly via temporary storefront spaces and traveling exhibitors or as acts in vaudeville programs a film could be under a minute long and would usually present a single scene authentic or staged of everyday life a public event a sporting event or slapstick there was little to no cinematic technique the film was usually black and white and it was without sound brothers auguste and louis lumière the novelty of realistic moving photographs was enough for a motion picture industry to blossom before the end of the century in countries around the world the cinema was to offer a cheaper simpler way of providing entertainment to the masses filmmakers could record actors performances which then could be shown to audiences around the world travelogues would bring the sights of far-flung places with movement directly to spectators hometowns movies would become the most popular visual art form of the late victorian age the berlin wintergarten theater hosted an early movie presentation in front of an audience shown by the skladanowsky brothers in 1895 the melbourne athenaeum started to screen movies in 1896 movie theaters became popular entertainment venues and social hubs in the early 20th century much like cabarets and other theaters a scene from a trip to the moon 1902 by georges méliès until 1927 motion pictures were produced without sound this era is referred to as the silent era of film to enhance the viewers experience silent films were commonly accompanied by live musicians in an orchestra a theatre organ and sometimes sound effects and even commentary spoken by the showman or projectionist in most countries intertitles came to be used to provide dialogue and narration for the film thus dispensing with narrators but in japanese cinema human narration remained popular throughout the silent era the technical problems were resolved by 1923 illustrated songs were a notable exception to this trend that began in 1894 in vaudeville houses and persisted as late as the late 1930s in film theaters live performance or sound recordings were paired with hand-colored glass slides projected through stereopticons and similar devices in this way song narrative was illustrated through a series of slides whose changes were simultaneous with the narrative development the main purpose of illustrated songs was to encourage sheet music sales and they were highly successful with sales reaching into the millions for a single song later with the birth of film illustrated songs were used as filler material preceding films and during reel changes the 1914 the photo-drama of creation was a non-commercial attempt to combine the motion picture with a combination of slides and synchronize the resulting moving picture with audio the film included hand-painted slides as well as other previously used techniques simultaneously playing the audio while the film was being played with a projector was required produced by the watch tower bible and tract society of pennsylvania jehovahs witnesses this eight–hour bible drama was being shown in 80 cities every day and almost eight million people in the united states and canada saw the presentation birth of movies edit the first eleven years of motion pictures show the cinema moving from a novelty to an established large-scale entertainment industry the films represent a movement from films consisting of one shot completely made by one person with a few assistants towards films several minutes long consisting of several shots which were made by large companies in something like industrial conditions the year 1900 marks the emergence of the first motion pictures that can be considered as films at this point film-makers begin to introduce basic editing techniques and film narrative invention and advancement of the camera edit georges méliès left painting a backdrop in his studio early movie cameras were fastened to the head of their tripod with only simple levelling devices provided these cameras were thus effectively fixed during the course of the shot and hence the first camera movements were the result of mounting a camera on a moving vehicle the lumière brothers shot a scene from the back of a train in 1896 the first rotating camera for taking panning shots was built by robert w paul in 1897 on the occasion of queen victoria s diamond jubilee he used his camera to shoot the procession in one shot his device had the camera mounted on a vertical axis that could be rotated by a worm gear driven by turning a crank handle and paul put it on general sale the next year shots taken using such a panning head were also referred to as panoramas in the film catalogues of the first decade of the cinema georges méliès built one of the first film studios in may 1897 it had a glass roof and three glass walls constructed after the model of large studios for still photography and it was fitted with thin cotton cloths that could be stretched below the roof to diffuse the direct rays of the sun on sunny days beginning in 1896 méliès would go on to produce direct and distribute over 500 short films the majority of these films were short one-shot films completed in one take méliès drew many comparisons between film and the stage which was apparent in his work he realized that film afforded him the ability via his use of timelapse photography to produce visual spectacles not achievable in the theater the execution of mary stuart produced by the edison company for viewing with the kinetoscope showed mary queen of scots being executed in full view of the camera the effect was achieved by replacing the actor with a dummy for the final shot georges méliès also utilized this technique in the making of escamotage dun dame chez robert-houdin the vanishing lady the woman is seen to vanish through the use of stop motion techniques a scene inset inside a circular vignette showing a dream vision in santa claus 1899 the other basic technique for trick cinematography was the double exposure of the film in the camera this was pioneered by george albert smith in july 1898 in england the set was draped in black and after the main shot the negative was re-exposed to the overlaid scene his the corsican brothers was described in the catalogue of the warwick trading company in 1900 by extremely careful photography the ghost appears quite transparent after indicating that he has been killed by a sword-thrust and appealing for vengeance he disappears a vision then appears showing the fatal duel in the snow g a smith also initiated the special effects technique of reverse motion he did this by repeating the action a second time while filming it with an inverted camera and then joining the tail of the second negative to that of the first the first films made using this device were tipsy topsy turvy and the awkward sign painter the earliest surviving example of this technique is smiths the house that jack built made before september 1900 cecil hepworth took this technique further by printing the negative of the forwards motion backwards frame by frame so producing a print in which the original action was exactly reversed to do this he built a special printer in which the negative running through a projector was projected into the gate of a camera through a special lens giving a same-size image this arrangement came to be called a projection printer and eventually an optical printer the use of different camera speeds also appeared around 1900 in the films of robert w paul and hepworth paul shot scenes from on a runaway motor car through piccadilly circus 1899 with the camera turning very slowly when the film was projected at the usual 16 frames per second the scenery appeared to be passing at great speed hepworth used the opposite effect in the indian chief and the seidlitz powder 1901 the chiefs movements are sped up by cranking the camera much faster than 16 frames per second this gives what we would call a slow motion effect film editing and continuous narrative edit the first films to consist of more than one shot appeared toward the end of the 19th century a notable example was the french film of the life of jesus christ by alice guy these werent represented as a continuous film the separate scenes were interspersed with lantern slides a lecture and live choral numbers to increase the running time of the spectacle to about 90 minutes another example of this is the reproductions of scenes from the greco-turkish war made by georges méliès in 1897 although each scene was sold separately they were shown one after the other by the exhibitors even méliès cendrillon cinderella of 1898 contained no action moving from one shot to the next one to understand what was going on in the film the audience had to know their stories beforehand or be told them by a presenter the two scenes making up come along do real film continuity involving action moving from one sequence into another is attributed to british film pioneer robert w paul s come along do made in 1898 and one of the first films to feature more than one shot in the first shot an elderly couple is outside an art exhibition having lunch and then follow other people inside through the door the second shot shows what they do inside pauls cinematograph camera no 1 of 1895 was the first camera to feature reverse-cranking which allowed the same film footage to be exposed several times and thereby to create super-positions and multiple exposures this technique was first used in his 1901 film scrooge or marleys ghost the further development of action continuity in multi-shot films continued in 1899 at the brighton school in england in the latter part of that year george albert smith made the kiss in the tunnel this started with a shot from a phantom ride at the point at which the train goes into a tunnel and continued with the action on a set representing the interior of a railway carriage where a man steals a kiss from a woman and then cuts back to the phantom ride shot when the train comes out of the tunnel a month later the bamforth company in yorkshire made a restaged version of this film under the same title and in this case they filmed shots of a train entering and leaving a tunnel from beside the tracks which they joined before and after their version of the kiss inside the train compartment the first two shots of as seen through a telescope 1900 with the telescope pov simulated by the circular mask in 1900 continuity of action across successive shots was definitively established by george albert smith and james williamson who also worked in brighton in that year smith made as seen through a telescope in which the main shot shows street scene with a young man tying the shoelace and then caressing the foot of his girlfriend while an old man observes this through a telescope there is then a cut to close shot of the hands on the girls foot shown inside a black circular mask and then a cut back to the continuation of the original scene even more remarkable is james williamson s attack on a china mission station 1900 the first shot shows chinese boxer rebels at the gate it then cuts to the missionary family in the garden where a fight ensues the wife signals to british sailors from the balcony who come and rescue them the film also used the first reverse angle cut in film history g a smith pioneered the use of the close-up shot in his 1900 films as seen through a telescope and grandmas reading glass he further developed the ideas of breaking a scene shot in one place into a series of shots taken from different camera positions over the next couple of years starting with the little doctors of 1901 in a series of films he produced at this time he also introduced the use of subjective and objective point-of-view shots the creation of dream-time and the use of reversing he summed up his work in mary janes mishap of 1903 with repeated cuts in to a close shot of a housemaid fooling around along with superimpositions and other devices before abandoning film-making to invent the kinemacolor system of colour cinematography his films were the first to establish the basics of coherent narrative and what became known as film language or film grammar james williamson concentrated on making films taking action from one place shown in one shot to the next shown in another shot in films like stop thief made in 1901 and many others he also experimented with the close-up and made perhaps the most extreme one of all in the big swallow when his character approaches the camera and appears to swallow it these two film makers of the brighton school also pioneered the editing of the film they tinted their work with color and used trick photography to enhance the narrative by 1900 their films were extended scenes of up to 5 minutes long most films of this period were what came to be called chase films these were inspired by james williamson s stop thief of 1901 which showed a tramp stealing a leg of mutton from a butchers boy in the first shot then being chased through the second shot by the butchers boy and assorted dogs and finally being caught by the dogs in the third shot several british films made in the first half of 1903 extended the chase method of film construction these included an elopement la mode and the pickpocket a chase through london made by alf collins for the british branch of the french gaumont company daring daylight burglary made by frank mottershaw at the sheffield photographic company and desperate poaching affray made by william haggar haggar in particular innovated the first extant panning shots the poachers are chased by gamekeepers and police officers and the camera pans along creating a sense of urgency and speed his films were also recognised for their intelligent use of depth of staging and screen edges while film academic noël burch praised haggars effective use of off-screen space he was also one of the first film makers to purposefully introduce violence for entertainment in desperate poaching affray the villains are seen firing guns at their pursuers still from the great train robbery produced by edwin s porter other filmmakers took up all these ideas including the american edwin s porter who started making films for the edison company in 1901 porter a projectionist was hired by thomas edison to develop his new projection model known as the vitascope porter wanted to develop a style of filmmaking that would move away from the one-shot short films into a story-telling narrative style when he began making longer films in 1902 he put a dissolve between every shot just as georges méliès was already doing and he frequently had the same action repeated across the dissolves his film the great train robbery 1903 had a running time of twelve minutes with twenty separate shots and ten different indoor and outdoor locations he used cross-cutting editing method to show simultaneous action in different places the time continuity in the great train robbery was actually more confusing than that in the films it was modeled on but nevertheless it was a greater success than them due to its wild west violence the great train robbery served as one of the vehicles that would launch the film medium into mass popularity the pathé company in france also made imitations and variations of smith and williamsons films from 1902 onwards using cuts between the shots which helped to standardize the basics of film construction an influential french film of the period was mélièss 14-minute-long a trip to the moon it was extremely popular at the time of its release and is the best-known of the hundreds of films made by méliès it was one of the first known science fiction films and used innovative animation and special effects including the well-known image of the spaceship landing in the moons eye the sheer volume of pathés production led to their filmmakers giving a further precision and polish to the details of film continuity animation edit the first use of animation in movies was in 1899 with the production of the short film matches an appeal by british film pioneer arthur melbourne-cooper a thirty-second long stop-motion animated piece intended to encourage the audience to send matches to british troops fighting the boer war the film contains an appeal to send money to bryant and may who would then send matches to the troops fighting in south africa it was shown in december 1899 at the empire theatre in london this film is the earliest known example of stop-motion animation little puppets constructed of matchsticks are writing the appeal on a black wall their movements are filmed frame by frame movement by movement a single frame from the humorous phases of funny faces animation showing the use of cut-out technique the relative sophistication of this piece was not followed up for some time with subsequent works in animation being limited to short two or three frame effects such as appeared in edwin stanton porter s 1902 short fun in a bakery shop where a lump of dough was made to smile over the course of a three-frame sequence works rivaling the british short in length did not appear until 1905 when edwin porter made how jones lost his roll and the whole dam family and the dam dog both of these films had intertitles which were formed by the letters moving into place from a random scattering to form the words of the titles this was done by exposing the film one frame at a time and moving the letters a little bit towards their final position between each exposure this is what has come to be called single frame animation or object animation and it needs a slightly adapted camera that exposes only one frame for each turn of the crank handle rather than the usual eight frames per turn ernst lubitsch known as the master of kostumfilme in 1906 albert edward smith and james stuart blackton at vitagraph studios took the next step and in their humorous phases of funny faces what appear to be cartoon drawings of people move from one pose to another this is done for most of the length of this film by moving jointed cut-outs of the figures frame by frame between the exposures just as porter moved his letters however there is a very short section of the film where things are made to appear to move by altering the drawings themselves from frame to frame which is how standard animated cartoons have since been made up to today el apóstol the worlds first animated feature film and peludópolis the first animated feature film with sound were produced in cutout animation by italian-born cartoonist quirino cristiani the technique of single frame animation was further developed in 1907 by edwin s porter in the teddy bears and by j stuart blackton with work made easy in the first of these the toy bears were made to move apparently on their own and in the latter film building tools were made to perform construction tasks without human intervention by using frame-by-frame animation the technique got to europe almost immediately and segundo de chomon and others at pathé took it further adding clay animation in which sculptures were deformed from one thing into another thing frame by frame in sculpture moderne 1908 and then pathé made the next step to the animation of silhouette shapes also in france émile cohl fully developed drawn animation in a series of films starting with fantasmagorie 1908 in which humans and objects drawn as outline figures went though a series of remarkable interactions and transformations in the united states the response was from the famous strip cartoon artist winsor mccay who drew much more realistic animated figures going through smoother more naturalistic motion in a series of films starting with the film little nemo made for vitagraph in 1911 in the next few years various others took part in this development of animated cartoons in the united states and elsewhere the worlds first animated feature film was el apóstol 1917 made by italian-argentine cartoonist quirino cristiani utilizing cutout animation cristiani also directed the first animated feature film with sound peludópolis released with a vitaphone sound-on-disc synchronization system soundtrack unfortunately a fire that destroyed producer federico valles film studio incinerated the only known copies of the movies and they are now considered as lost films in 1932 the first short animated film created entirely with technicolor the trichromatic procedure green red blue whose use required a triple photographic impression incorporation of chromatic filters and cameras of enormous dimensions was walt disney s flowers and trees directed by burt gillett feature film edit see also feature film hollywood sign films at the time were no longer than one reel although some multi-reel films had been made on the life of christ in the first few years of cinema the first feature length multi-reel film in the world was the 1906 australian production called the story of the kelly gang it traced the life of the legendary infamous outlaw and bushranger ned kelly 1855 1880 and ran for more than an hour with a reel length of approximately 4,000 feet 1,200 m it was first shown at the athenaeum hall in collins street melbourne australia on 26 december 1906 and in the uk in january 1908 maturation edit film business edit poster for a biograph studios release from 1913 the first successful permanent theatre showing only films was the nickelodeon which was opened in pittsburgh in 1905 by then there were enough films several minutes long available to fill a programme running for at least half an hour and which could be changed weekly when the local audience became bored with it other exhibitors in the united states quickly followed suit and within a couple of years there were thousands of these nickelodeons in operation the american experience led to a worldwide boom in the production and exhibition of films from 1906 onwards by 1907 purpose-built cinemas for motion pictures were being opened across the united states britain and france the films were often shown with the accompaniment of music provided by a pianist though there could be more musicians there were also a very few larger cinemas in some of the biggest cities initially the majority of films in the programmes were pathé films but this changed fairly quickly as the american companies cranked up production the programme was made up of just a few films and the show lasted around 30 minutes the reel of film of maximum length 1,000 feet 300 m which usually contained one individual film became the standard unit of film production and exhibition in this period the programme was changed twice or more a week but went up to five changes of programme a week after a couple of years in general cinemas were set up in the established entertainment districts of the cities in 1907 pathé began renting their films to cinemas through film exchanges rather than selling the films outright play media an early film depicting a re-enactment of the battle of chemulpo bay film produced in 1904 by edison studios by about 1910 actors began to receive screen credit for their roles and the way to the creation of film stars was opened films were increasingly longer and began to feature proper plots and development the litigation over patents between all the major american film-making companies led to the formation of a trust to control the american film business with each company in the trust being allocated production quotas two reels a week for the biggest ones one reel a week for the smaller however although 6,000 exhibitors signed up to the trust about 2,000 others did not and began to fund new film producing companies by 1912 the independents had nearly half of the market and the government defeated the trust by initiating anti-trust action at the same time in the early 20th century before hollywood the motion picture industry was based in fort lee new jersey across the hudson river from new york city in need of a winter headquarters moviemakers were attracted to jacksonville florida due to its warm climate exotic locations excellent rail access and cheaper labor earning the city the title of the winter film capital of the world new york-based kalem studios was the first to open a permanent studio in jacksonville in 1908 over the course of the next decade more than 30 silent film companies established studios in town including metro pictures later mgm edison studios majestic films king bee film company vim comedy company norman studios gaumont studios and the lubin manufacturing company comedic actor and georgia native oliver babe hardy began his motion picture career here in 1914 he starred in over 36 short silent films his first year acting with the closing of lubin in early 1915 oliver moved to new york then new jersey to find film jobs acquiring a job with the vim company in early 1915 he returned to jacksonville in the spring of 1917 before relocating to los angeles in october 1917 the first motion picture made in technicolor and the first feature-length color movie produced in the united states the gulf between was also filmed on location in jacksonville in 1917 jacksonville was especially important to the african american film industry one notable individual in this regard is the european american producer richard norman who created a string of films starring black actors in the vein of oscar micheaux and the lincoln motion picture company in contrast to the degrading parts offered in certain white films such as the birth of a nation norman and his contemporaries sought to create positive stories featuring african americans in what he termed splendidly assuming different roles jacksonvilles mostly conservative residents however objected to the hallmarks of the early movie industry such as car chases in the streets simulated bank robberies and fire alarms in public places and even the occasional riot in 1917 conservative democrat john w martin was elected mayor on the platform of taming the citys movie industry by that time southern california was emerging as the major movie production center thanks in large part to the move of film pioneers like william selig and d w griffith to the area these factors quickly sealed the demise of jacksonville as a major film destination another factor for the industrys move west was that up until 1913 most american film production was still carried out around new york but due to the monopoly of thomas a edison inc s film patents and its litigious attempts to preserve it many filmmakers moved to southern california starting with selig in 1909 the sunshine and scenery was important for the production of westerns which came to form a major american film genre with the first cowboy stars g m anderson broncho billy and tom mix selig pioneered the use of fairly wild animals from a zoo for a series of exotic adventures with the actors being menaced or saved by the animals kalem company sent film crews to places in america and abroad to film stories in the actual places they were supposed to have happened kalem also pioneered the female action heroine from 1912 with ruth roland playing starring roles in their westerns in france pathé retained its dominant position followed still by gaumont and then other new companies that appeared to cater to the film boom a film company with a different approach was film dart this was set up at the beginning of 1908 to make films of a serious artistic nature their declared programme was to make films using only the best dramatists artists and actors the first of these was lassassinat du duc de guise the assassination of the duc de guise a historical subject set in the court of henri iii this film used leading actors from the comédie-française and had a special accompanying score written by camille saint-saëns the other french majors followed suit and this wave gave rise to the english-language description of films with artistic pretensions aimed at a sophisticated audience as art films by 1910 the french film companies were starting to make films as long as two or even three reels though most were still one reel long this trend was followed in italy denmark and sweden in britain the cinematograph act 1909 was the first primary legislation to specifically regulate the film industry film exhibitions often took place in temporary venues and the use of highly flammable cellulose nitrate for film combined with limelight illumination created a significant fire hazard the act specified a strict building code which required amongst other things that the projector be enclosed within a fire resisting enclosure regular newsreels were exhibited from 1910 and soon became a popular way for finding out the news the british antarctic expedition to the south pole was filmed for the newsreels as were the suffragette demonstrations that were happening at the same time f percy smith was an early nature documentary pioneer working for charles urban and he pioneered the use of time lapse and micro cinematography in his 1910 documentary on the growth of flowers new film producing countries edit with the worldwide film boom yet more countries now joined britain france germany and the united states in serious film production in italy production was spread over several centres with turin being the first and biggest there ambrosio was the first company in the field in 1905 and remained the largest in the country through this period its most substantial rival was cines in rome which started producing in 1906 the great strength of the italian industry was historical epics with large casts and massive scenery as early as 1911 giovanni pastrone s two-reel la caduta di troia the fall of troy made a big impression worldwide and it was followed by even bigger spectacles like quo vadis 1912 which ran for 90 minutes and pastrones cabiria of 1914 which ran for two and a half hours la caduta di troia the fall of troy 1911 italian companies also had a strong line in slapstick comedy with actors like andré deed known locally as cretinetti and elsewhere as foolshead and gribouille achieving worldwide fame with his almost surrealistic gags the most important film-producing country in northern europe up until the first world war was denmark the nordisk company was set up there in 1906 by ole olsen a fairground showman and after a brief period imitating the successes of french and british filmmakers in 1907 he produced 67 films most directed by viggo larsen with sensational subjects like den hvide slavinde the white slave isbjørnenjagt polar bear hunt and løvejagten the lion hunt by 1910 new smaller danish companies began joining the business and besides making more films about the white slave trade they contributed other new subjects the most important of these finds was asta nielsen in afgrunden the abyss directed by urban gad for kosmorama this combined the circus sex jealousy and murder all put over with great conviction and pushed the other danish filmmakers further in this direction by 1912 the danish film companies were multiplying rapidly the swedish film industry was smaller and slower to get started than the danish industry here the important man was charles magnusson a newsreel cameraman for the svenskabiografteatern cinema chain he started fiction film production for them in 1909 directing a number of the films himself production increased in 1912 when the company engaged victor sjöström and mauritz stiller as directors they started out by imitating the subjects favoured by the danish film industry but by 1913 they were producing their own strikingly original work which sold very well russia began its film industry in 1908 with pathé shooting some fiction subjects there and then the creation of real russian film companies by aleksandr drankov and aleksandr khanzhonkov the khanzhonkov company quickly became much the largest russian film company and remained so until 1918 in germany oskar messter had been involved in film-making from 1896 but did not make a significant number of films per year till 1910 when the worldwide film boom started he and the few other people in the german film business continued to sell prints of their own films outright which put them at a disadvantage it was only when paul davidson the owner of a chain of cinemas brought asta nielsen and urban gad to germany from denmark in 1911 and set up a production company projektions-ag union pagu for them that a change-over to renting prints began messter replied with a series of longer films starring henny porten but although these did well in the german-speaking world they were not particularly successful internationally unlike the asta nielsen films another of the growing german film producers just before world war i was the german branch of the french éclair company deutsche éclair this was expropriated by the german government and turned into decla when the war started but altogether german producers only had a minor part of the german market in 1914 overall from about 1910 american films had the largest share of the market in all european countries except france and even in france the american films had just pushed the local production out of first place on the eve of world war i so even if the war had not happened american films may have become dominant worldwide although the war made things much worse for european producers the technical qualities of american films made them increasingly attractive to audiences everywhere film technique edit a e smith filming the bargain fiend in the vitagraph studios in 1907 arc floodlights hang overhead new film techniques that were introduced in this period include the use of artificial lighting fire effects and low-key lighting i e lighting in which most of the frame is dark for enhanced atmosphere during sinister scenes continuity of action from shot to shot was also refined such as in pathés le cheval emballé the runaway horse 1907 where cross-cutting between parallel actions is used d w griffith also began using cross-cutting in the film the fatal hour made in july 1908 another development was the use of the point of view shot first used in 1910 in vitagraphs back to nature insert shots were also used for artistic purposes the italian film la mala planta the evil plant directed by mario caserini had an insert shot of a snake slithering over the evil plant as films grew longer specialist writers were employed to simplify more complex stories derived from novels or plays into a form that could be contained on one reel genres began to be used as categories the main division was into comedy and drama but these categories were further subdivided intertitles containing lines of dialogue began to be used consistently from 1908 onwards such as in vitagraphs an auto heroine or the race for the vitagraph cup and how it was won the dialogue was eventually inserted into the middle of the scene and became commonplace by 1912 the introduction of dialogue titles transformed the nature of film narrative when dialogue titles came to be always cut into a scene just after a character starts speaking and then left with a cut to the character just before they finish speaking then one had something that was effectively the equivalent of a present-day sound film during world war i edit industry edit the visual style of the cabinet of dr caligari included deliberately distorted forms and shadows and streaks of light painted directly onto the sets it uses mise-en-scène the years of the first world war were a complex transitional period for the film industry the exhibition of films changed from short one-reel programmes to feature films exhibition venues became larger and began charging higher prices in the united states these changes brought destruction to many film companies the vitagraph company being an exception film production began to shift to los angeles during world war i the universal film manufacturing company was formed in 1912 as an umbrella company new entrants included the jesse lasky feature play company and famous players both formed in 1913 and later amalgamated into famous players-lasky the biggest success of these years was david wark griffith s the birth of a nation 1915 griffith followed this up with the even bigger intolerance 1916 but due to the high quality of film produced in the us the market for their films was high in france film production shut down due to the general military mobilization of the country at the start of the war although film production began again in 1915 it was on a reduced scale and the biggest companies gradually retired from production italian film production held up better although so called diva films starring anguished female leads were a commercial failure in denmark the nordisk company increased its production so much in 1915 and 1916 that it could not sell all its films which led to a very sharp decline in danish production and the end of denmarks importance on the world film scene the german film industry was seriously weakened by the war the most important of the new film producers at the time was joe may who made a series of thrillers and adventure films through the war years but ernst lubitsch also came into prominence with a series of very successful comedies and dramas because of the large local market for films in russia the industry there was not harmed by the war at first although the isolation of the country led many russian films to develop peculiarly distinctive features in 1919 after the bolshevik revolution an exodus of talent from the country took place and film production was drastically curtailed new techniques edit complex vignette shot in die austernprinzessin the oyster princess at this time studios were blacked out to allow shooting to be unaffected by changing sunlight this was replaced with floodlights and spotlights the widespread adoption of irising-in and out to begin and end scenes caught on in this period this is the revelation of a film shot in a circular mask which gradually gets larger till it expands beyond the frame other shaped slits were used including vertical and diagonal apertures a new idea taken over from still photography was soft focus this began in 1915 with some shots being intentionally thrown out of focus for expressive effect as in mary pickford starrer fanchon the cricket it was during this period that camera effects intended to convey the subjective feelings of characters in a film really began to be established these could now be done as point of view pov shots as in sidney drews the story of the glove 1915 where a wobbly hand-held shot of a door and its keyhole represents the pov of a drunken man the use of anamorphic in the general sense of distorted shape images first appears in these years with abel gance directed la folie du docteur tube the madness of dr tube in this film the effect of a drug administered to a group of people was suggested by shooting the scenes reflected in a distorting mirror of the fair-ground type symbolic effects taken over from conventional literary and artistic tradition continued to make some appearances in films during these years in d w griffiths the avenging conscience 1914 the title the birth of the evil thought precedes a series of three shots of the protagonist looking at a spider and ants eating an insect symbolist art and literature from the turn of the century also had a more general effect on a small number of films made in italy and russia the supine acceptance of death resulting from passion and forbidden longings was a major feature of this art and states of delirium dwelt on at length were important as well insert shot in old wives for new cecil b demille 1918 the use of insert shots i e close-ups of objects other than faces had already been established by the brighton school but were infrequently used before 1914 it is really only with griffiths the avenging conscience that a new phase in the use of the insert shot starts as well as the symbolic inserts already mentioned the film also made extensive use of large numbers of big close up shots of clutching hands and tapping feet as a means of emphasizing those parts of the body as indicators of psychological tension atmospheric inserts were developed in europe in the late 1910s this kind of shot is one in a scene which neither contains any of the characters in the story nor is a point of view shot seen by one of them an early example is in maurice tourneur directed the pride of the clan 1917 in which there is a series of shots of waves beating on a rocky shore to demonstrate the harsh lives of the fishing folk maurice elvey s nelson the story of englands immortal naval hero 1919 has a symbolic sequence dissolving from a picture of kaiser wilhelm ii to a peacock and then to a battleship lev kuleshov the founders of the worlds first film school the moscow film school development of the style of film a principle known as the kuleshov effect by 1914 continuity cinema was the established mode of commercial cinema one of the advanced continuity techniques involved an accurate and smooth transition from one shot to another cutting to different angles within a scene also became well-established as a technique for dissecting a scene into shots in american films if the direction of the shot changes by more than ninety degrees it is called a reverse-angle cutting the leading figure in the full development of reverse-angle cutting was ralph ince in his films such as the right girl and his phantom sweetheart the use of flash-back structures continued to develop in this period with the usual way of entering and leaving a flash-back being through a dissolve the vitagraph companys the man that might have been william j humphrey 1914 is even more complex with a series of reveries and flash-backs that contrast the protagonists real passage through life with what might have been if his son had not died after 1914 cross cutting between parallel actions came to be used more so in american films than in european ones cross-cutting was often used to get new effects of contrast such as the cross-cut sequence in cecil b demille s the whispering chorus 1918 in which a supposedly dead husband is having a liaison with a chinese prostitute in an opium den while simultaneously his unknowing wife is being remarried in church film art edit the new tower of babel fredersens headquarters in metropolis the tower of babel in marias recounting of the fable was modeled after this 1563 painting by pieter brueghel the general trend in the development of cinema led from the united states was towards using the newly developed specifically filmic devices for expression of the narrative content of film stories and combining this with the standard dramatic structures already in use in commercial theatre d w griffith had the highest standing amongst american directors in the industry because of the dramatic excitement he conveyed to the audience through his films cecil b demille s the cheat 1915 brought out the moral dilemmas facing their characters in a more subtle way than griffith demille was also in closer touch with the reality of contemporary american life maurice tourneur was also highly ranked for the pictorial beauties of his films together with the subtlety of his handling of fantasy while at the same time he was capable of getting greater naturalism from his actors at appropriate moments as in a girls folly 1917 sidney drew was the leader in developing polite comedy while slapstick was refined by fatty arbuckle and charles chaplin who both started with mack sennett s keystone company they reduced the usual frenetic pace of sennetts films to give the audience a chance to appreciate the subtlety and finesse of their movement and the cleverness of their gags by 1917 chaplin was also introducing more dramatic plot into his films and mixing the comedy with sentiment in russia yevgeni bauer put a slow intensity of acting combined with symbolist overtones onto film in a unique way in sweden victor sjöström made a series of films that combined the realities of peoples lives with their surroundings in a striking manner while mauritz stiller developed sophisticated comedy to a new level in germany ernst lubitsch got his inspiration from the stage work of max reinhardt both in bourgeois comedy and in spectacle and applied this to his films culminating in his die puppe the doll die austernprinzessin the oyster princess and madame dubarry hollywood triumphant edit charlie chaplin at the start of the first world war french and italian cinema had been the most globally popular the war came as a devastating interruption to european film industries the american industry or hollywood as it was becoming known after its new geographical center in california gained the position it has held more or less ever since film factory for the world and exporting its product to most countries on earth by the 1920s the united states reached what is still its era of greatest-ever output producing an average of 800 feature films annually or 82% of the global total eyman 1997 the comedies of charlie chaplin and buster keaton the swashbuckling adventures of douglas fairbanks and the romances of clara bow to cite just a few examples made these performers faces well-known on every continent the western visual norm that would become classical continuity editing was developed and exported although its adoption was slower in some non-western countries without strong realist traditions in art and drama such as japan this development was contemporary with the growth of the studio system and its greatest publicity method the star system which characterized american film for decades to come and provided models for other film industries the studios efficient top-down control over all stages of their product enabled a new and ever-growing level of lavish production and technical sophistication at the same time the systems commercial regimentation and focus on glamorous escapism discouraged daring and ambition beyond a certain degree a prime example being the brief but still legendary directing career of the iconoclastic erich von stroheim in the late teens and the 20s sound era edit main article sound film see also 1930s in film don juan is the first feature-length film to utilize the vitaphone sound-on-disc sound system with a synchronized musical score and sound effects though it has no spoken dialogue during late 1927 warners released the jazz singer which was mostly silent but contained what is generally regarded as the first synchronized dialogue and singing in a feature film but this process was actually accomplished first by charles taze russell in 1914 with the lengthy film the photo-drama of creation this drama consisted of picture slides and moving pictures synchronized with phonograph records of talks and music the early sound-on-disc processes such as vitaphone were soon superseded by sound-on-film methods like fox movietone deforest phonofilm and rca photophone the trend convinced the largely reluctant industrialists that talking pictures or talkies were the future a lot of attempts were made before the success of the jazz singer that can be seen in the list of film sound systems the change was remarkably swift by the end of 1929 hollywood was almost all-talkie with several competing sound systems soon to be standardized total changeover was slightly slower in the rest of the world principally for economic reasons cultural reasons were also a factor in countries like china and japan where silents co-existed successfully with sound well into the 1930s indeed producing what would be some of the most revered classics in those countries like wu yonggang s the goddess china 1934 and yasujirō ozu s i was born but japan 1932 but even in japan a figure such as the benshi the live narrator who was a major part of japanese silent cinema found his acting career was ending sound further tightened the grip of major studios in numerous countries the vast expense of the transition overwhelmed smaller competitors while the novelty of sound lured vastly larger audiences for those producers that remained in the case of the u s some historians credit sound with saving the hollywood studio system in the face of the great depression parkinson 1995 thus began what is now often called the golden age of hollywood which refers roughly to the period beginning with the introduction of sound until the late 1940s the american cinema reached its peak of efficiently manufactured glamour and global appeal during this period the

shirley temple creative impact of sound edit clark gable vivien leigh leslie howard olivia de havilland creatively however the rapid transition was a difficult one and in some ways film briefly reverted to the conditions of its earliest days the late 20s were full of static stagey talkies as artists in front of and behind the camera struggled with the stringent limitations of the early sound equipment and their own uncertainty as to how to utilize the new medium many stage performers directors and writers were introduced to cinema as producers sought personnel experienced in dialogue-based storytelling many major silent filmmakers and actors were unable to adjust and found their careers severely curtailed or even ended this awkward period was fairly short-lived 1929 was a watershed year william wellman with chinatown nights and the man i love rouben mamoulian with applause alfred hitchcock with blackmail britains first sound feature were among the directors to bring greater fluidity to talkies and experiment with the expressive use of sound eyman 1997 in this they both benefited from and pushed further technical advances in microphones and cameras and capabilities for editing and post-synchronizing sound rather than recording all sound directly at the time of filming walt disney introduces each of the seven dwarfs in a scene from the original 1937 snow white theatrical trailer sound films emphasized black history and benefited different genres more so than silents did most obviously the musical film was born the first classic-style hollywood musical was the broadway melody 1929 and the form would find its first major creator in choreographer director busby berkeley 42nd street 1933 dames 1934 in france avant-garde director rené clair made

1937 1939 a major year for american cinema brought such films as the wizard of oz and gone with the wind color in cinema edit previously it was believed that color films were first projected in 1909 at the palace theatre in london the main problem with the color being that the technique created by george smith kinemacolor only used two colors green and red which were mixed additively but in fact it was in 1901 when the first color film in history was created this untitled film was directed by photographer edward raymond turner and his patron frederick marshall lee the way they did it was to use black and white film rolls but have green red and blue filters go over the camera individually as it shot to complete the film they joined the original footage and filters on a special projector however both the shooting of the film and its projection suffered from major unrelated issues that eventually sank the idea subsequently in 1916 the technicolor technique arrived trichromatic procedure green red blue its use required a triple photographic impression incorporation of chromatic filters and cameras of enormous dimensions the first audiovisual piece that was completely realized with this technique was the short of walt disney flowers and trees directed by burt gillett in 1932 even so the first film to be performed with this technique will be the vanities fair 1935

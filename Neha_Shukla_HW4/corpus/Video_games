video game wikipedia video games redirects here for other uses see video games disambiguation people playing a large scale version of the iconic pong video game at the national videogame museum a video game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a tv screen or computer monitor the word video in video game traditionally referred to a raster display device but as of the 2000s it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images some theorists categorize video games as an art form but this designation is controversial the electronic systems used to play video games are known as platforms examples of these are personal computers and video game consoles these platforms range from large mainframe computers to small handheld computing devices specialized video games such as arcade games in which the video game components are housed in a large typically coin-operated chassis while common in the 1980s in video arcades have gradually declined due to the widespread availability of affordable home video game consoles e g playstation 4 xbox one and nintendo wii u and video games on desktop and laptop computers and smartphones the input device used for games the game controller varies across platforms common controllers include gamepads joysticks mouse devices keyboards the touchscreens of mobile devices and buttons or even with the kinect sensor a persons hands and body players typically view the game on a video screen or television or computer monitor or sometimes on virtual reality head-mounted display goggles there are often game sound effects music and in the 2010s voice actor lines which come from loudspeakers or headphones some games in the 2000s include haptic vibration-creating effects force feedback peripherals and virtual reality headsets in the 2010s the video game industry is of increasing commercial importance with growth driven particularly by the emerging asian markets and mobile games which are played on smartphones as of 2015 video games generated sales of usd 74 billion annually worldwide and were the third-largest segment in the u s entertainment market behind broadcast and cable tv history main article history of video games see also early history of video games tennis for two an early analog computer game that used an oscilloscope for a display a modern recreation of a controller for tennis for two early games used interactive electronic devices with various display formats the earliest example is from 1947—a cathode ray tube amusement device was filed for a patent on 25 january 1947 by thomas t goldsmith jr and estle ray mann and issued on 14 december 1948 as u s patent 2455992 inspired by radar display technology it consisted of an analog device that allowed a user to control a vector-drawn dot on the screen to simulate a missile being fired at targets which were drawings fixed to the screen other early examples include the nimrod computer at the 1951 festival of britain oxo a tic-tac-toe computer game by alexander s douglas for the edsac in 1952 tennis for two an electronic interactive game engineered by william higinbotham in 1958 spacewar written by mit students martin graetz steve russell and wayne wiitanens on a dec pdp-1 computer in 1961 and the hit ping pong -style pong a 1972 game by atari each game used different means of display nimrod used a panel of lights to play the game of nim oxo used a graphical display to play tic-tac-toe tennis for two used an oscilloscope to display a side view of a tennis court and spacewar used the dec pdp-1s vector display to have two spaceships battle each other nolan bushnell at the game developers conference in 2011 in 1971 computer space created by nolan bushnell and ted dabney was the first commercially sold coin-operated video game it used a black-and-white television for its display and the computer system was made of 74 series ttl chips the game was featured in the 1973 science fiction film soylent green computer space was followed in 1972 by the magnavox odyssey the first home console modeled after a late 1960s prototype console developed by ralph h baer called the brown box it also used a standard television these were followed by two versions of atari s pong an arcade version in 1972 and a home version in 1975 that dramatically increased video game popularity the commercial success of pong led numerous other companies to develop pong clones and their own systems spawning the video game industry a flood of pong clones eventually led to the video game crash of 1977 which came to an end with the mainstream success of taito s 1978 shooter game space invaders marking the beginning of the golden age of arcade video games and inspiring dozens of manufacturers to enter the market the game inspired arcade machines to become prevalent in mainstream locations such as shopping malls traditional storefronts restaurants and convenience stores the game also became the subject of numerous articles and stories on television and in newspapers and magazines establishing video gaming as a rapidly growing mainstream hobby space invaders was soon licensed for the atari vcs later known as atari 2600 becoming the first killer app and quadrupling the consoles sales this helped atari recover from their earlier losses and in turn the atari vcs revived the home video game market during the second generation of consoles up until the north american video game crash of 1983 the home video game industry was revitalized shortly afterwards by the widespread success of the nintendo entertainment system which marked a shift in the dominance of the video game industry from the united states to japan during the third generation of consoles overview platforms see also history of video games after pong the atari 2600 was the first game console to achieve widespread success and awareness the term platform refers to the specific combination of electronic components or computer hardware which in conjunction with software allows a video game to operate the term system is also commonly used the distinctions below are not always clear and there may be games that bridge one or more platforms in addition to personal computers there are other devices which have the ability to play games but are not dedicated video game machines such as smartphones pdas and graphing calculators pc in common use a pc game refers to a form of media that involves a player interacting with a personal computer connected to a video monitor personal computers are not dedicated game platforms so there may be differences running the same game in different hardware also the openness allows some features to developers like reduced software cost increased flexibility increased innovation emulation creation of modifications mods open hosting for online gaming in which a person plays a video game with people who are in a different household and others console an xbox 360 console and controller a console game is played on a specialized electronic device that connects to a common television set or composite video monitor unlike pcs which can run all sorts of computer programs a console is a dedicated video game platform manufactured by a specific company usually consoles only run games developed for it or games from other platform made by the same company but never games developed by its direct competitor even if the same game is available on different platforms it often comes with a specific game controller major console platforms include xbox playstation and nintendo handheld the nintendo game boy was the first successful handheld console selling over 100 million systems a handheld gaming device is a small self-contained electronic device that is portable and can be held in a users hands it features the console a small screen speakers and buttons joystick or other game controllers in a single unit like consoles handhelds are dedicated platforms and share almost the same characteristics handheld hardware usually is less powerful than pc or console hardware some handheld games from the late 1970s and early 1980s could only play one game in the 1990s and 2000s a number of handheld games used cartridges which enabled them to be used to play many different games arcade a horror-themed arcade game in which players use a light gun arcade game generally refers to a game played on an even more specialized type of electronic device that is typically designed to play only one game and is encased in a special large coin-operated cabinet which has one built-in console controllers joystick buttons etc a crt screen and audio amplifier and speakers arcade games often have brightly painted logos and images relating to the theme of the game while most arcade games are housed in a vertical cabinet which the user typically stands in front of to play some arcade games use a tabletop approach in which the display screen is housed in a table-style cabinet with a see-through table top with table-top games the users typically sit to play in the 1990s and 2000s some arcade games offered players a choice of multiple games in the 1980s video arcades were businesses in which game players could use a number of arcade video games in the 2010s there are far fewer video arcades but some movie theaters and family entertainment centers still have them web browser the web browser has also established itself as platform in its own right in the 2000s while providing a cross-platform environment for video games designed to be played on a wide spectrum of hardware from personal computers and tablet computers to smartphones this in turn has generated new terms to qualify classes of web browser-based games these games may be identified based on the website that they appear such as with facebook games others are named based on the programming platform used to develop them such as java and flash games mobile with the advent of standard operating systems for mobile devices such as ios and android and devices with greater hardware performance mobile gaming has become a significant platform while many mobile games share similar concepts with browser games these games may utilize features of smart devices that are not necessary present on other platforms such as global positing information and camera devices to support augmented reality gameplay mobile games also led into the development of microtransactions as a valid revenue model for casual games virtual reality virtual reality vr games generally require players to use a special head-mounted unit that provides stereoscopic screens and motion tracking to immerse a player within virtual environment that responds to their head movements some vr systems include control units for the players hands as to provide a direct way to interact with the virtual world vr systems generally require a separate computer console or other processing device that couples with the head-mounted unit blockchain a new platform of video games emerged in late 2017 in which users could take ownership of game assets digital assets using blockchain technologies an example of this is cryptokitties genres main article video game genre a video game like most other forms of media may be categorized into genres video game genres are used to categorize video games based on their gameplay interaction rather than visual or narrative differences a video game genre is defined by a set of gameplay challenges and are classified independent of their setting or game-world content unlike other works of fiction such as films or books for example a shooter game is still a shooter game regardless of whether it takes place in a fantasy world or in outer space because genres are dependent on content for definition genres have changed and evolved as newer styles of video games have come into existence ever advancing technology and production values related to video game development have fostered more lifelike and complex games which have in turn introduced or enhanced genre possibilities e g virtual pets pushed the boundaries of existing video gaming or in some cases add new possibilities in play such as that seen with games specifically designed for devices like sonys eyetoy some genres represent combinations of others such as massively multiplayer online role-playing games or more commonly mmorpgs it is also common to see higher level genre terms that are collective in nature across all other genres such as with action music rhythm or horror-themed video games classifications casual games main article casual game casual games derive their name from their ease of accessibility simple to understand gameplay and quick to grasp rule sets additionally casual games frequently support the ability to jump in and out of play on demand casual games as a format existed long before the term was coined and include video games such as solitaire or minesweeper which can commonly be found pre-installed with many versions of the microsoft windows operating system examples of genres within this category are match three hidden object time management puzzle or many of the tower defense style games casual games are generally available through app stores and online retailers such as popcap zylom and gamehouse or provided for free play through web portals such as newgrounds while casual games are most commonly played on personal computers phones or tablets they can also be found on many of the on-line console system download services e g the playstation network wiiware or xbox live serious games main article serious game serious games are games that are designed primarily to convey information or a learning experience to the player some serious games may even fail to qualify as a video game in the traditional sense of the term educational software does not typically fall under this category e g touch typing tutors language learning programs etc and the primary distinction would appear to be based on the games primary goal as well as target age demographics as with the other categories this description is more of a guideline than a rule serious games are games generally made for reasons beyond simple entertainment and as with the core and casual games may include works from any given genre although some such as exercise games educational games or propaganda games may have a higher representation in this group due to their subject matter these games are typically designed to be played by professionals as part of a specific job or for skill set improvement they can also be created to convey social-political awareness on a specific subject a screenshot from microsoft flight simulator showing a beech 1900d one of the longest-running serious games franchises would be microsoft flight simulator first published in 1982 under that name the united states military uses virtual reality based simulations such as vbs1 for training exercises as do a growing number of first responder roles e g police firefighters emts one example of a non-game environment utilized as a platform for serious game development would be the virtual world of second life which is currently used by several united states governmental departments e g noaa nasa jpl universities e g ohio university mit for educational and remote learning programs and businesses e g ibm cisco systems for meetings and training tactical media in video games plays a crucial role in making a statement or conveying a message on important relevant issues this form of media allows for a broader audience to be able to receive and gain access to certain information that otherwise may not have reached such people an example of tactical media in video games would be newsgames these are short games related to contemporary events designed to illustrate a point for example take action games is a game studio collective that was co-founded by susana ruiz and has made successful serious games some of these games include darfur is dying finding zoe and in the balance all of these games bring awareness to important issues and events educational games see also educational video games and educational software a vtech educational video game on 23 september 2009 u s president barack obama launched a campaign called educate to innovate aimed at improving the technological mathematical scientific and engineering abilities of american students this campaign states that it plans to harness the power of interactive games to help achieve the goal of students excelling in these departments this campaign has stemmed into many new opportunities for the video game realm and has contributed to many new competitions some of these competitions include the stem national video game competition and the imagine cup both of these bring a focus to relevant and important current issues through gaming www nobelprize org entices the user to learn about information pertaining to the nobel prize achievements while engaging in a fun video game there are many different types and styles of educational games including counting to spelling to games for kids to games for adults some other games do not have any particular targeted audience in mind and intended to simply educate or inform whoever views or plays the game controllers main article game controller a north american super nes game controller from the early 1990s video game can use several types of input devices to translate human actions to a game the most common game controllers are keyboard and mouse for pc games consoles usually come with specific gamepads handheld consoles have built in buttons other game controllers are commonly used for specific games like racing wheels light guns or dance pads digital cameras can also be used as game controllers capturing movements of the body of the player as technology continues to advance more can be added onto the controller to give the player a more immersive experience when playing different games there are some controllers that have presets so that the buttons are mapped a certain way to make playing certain games easier along with the presets a player can sometimes custom map the buttons to better accommodate their play style on keyboard and mouse different actions in the game are already preset to keys on the keyboard most games allow the player to change that so that the actions are mapped to different keys that are more to their liking the companies that design the controllers are trying to make the controller visually appealing and also feel comfortable in the hands of the consumer an example of a technology that was incorporated into the controller was the touchscreen it allows the player to be able to interact with the game differently than before the person could move around in menus easier and they are also able to interact with different objects in the game they can pick up some objects equip others or even just move the objects out of the players path another example is motion sensor where a persons movement is able to be captured and put into a game some motion sensor games are based on where the controller is the reason for that is because there is a signal that is sent from the controller to the console or computer so that the actions being done can create certain movements in the game other type of motion sensor games are webcam style where the player moves around in front of it and the actions are repeated by a game character development main article game development see also video game industry practices developers use various tools to create video games here an editor is fine-tuning the virtual camera system video game development and authorship much like any other form of entertainment is frequently a cross-disciplinary field video game developers as employees within this industry are commonly referred primarily include programmers and graphic designers over the years this has expanded to include almost every type of skill that one might see prevalent in the creation of any movie or television program including sound designers musicians and other technicians as well as skills that are specific to video games such as the game designer all of these are managed by producers in the early days of the industry it was more common for a single person to manage all of the roles needed to create a video game as platforms have become more complex and powerful in the type of material they can present larger teams have been needed to generate all of the art programming cinematography and more this is not to say that the age of the one-man shop is gone as this is still sometimes found in the casual gaming and handheld markets where smaller games are prevalent due to technical limitations such as limited ram or lack of dedicated 3d graphics rendering capabilities on the target platform e g some cellphones and pdas with the growth of the size of development teams in the industry the problem of cost has increased development studios need to be able to pay their staff a competitive wage in order to attract and retain the best talent while publishers are constantly looking to keep costs down in order to maintain profitability on their investment typically a video game console development team can range in sizes of anywhere from 5 to 50 people with some teams exceeding 100 in may 2009 one game project was reported to have a development staff of 450 the growth of team size combined with greater pressure to get completed projects into the market to begin recouping production costs has led to a greater occurrence of missed deadlines rushed games and the release of unfinished products downloadable content main article downloadable content a phenomenon of additional game content at a later date often for additional funds began with digital video game distribution known as downloadable content dlc developers can use digital distribution to issue new storylines after the main game is released such as rockstar games with grand theft auto iv the lost and damned and the ballad of gay tony or bethesda with fallout 3 and its expansions new gameplay modes can also become available for instance call of duty and its zombie modes a multiplayer mode for mushroom wars or a higher difficulty level for metro last light smaller packages of dlc are also common ranging from better in-game weapons dead space just cause 2 character outfits littlebigplanet minecraft or new songs to perform singstar rock band guitar hero expansion packs main article expansion pack a variation of downloadable content is expansion packs unlike dlc expansion packs add a whole section to the game that either already exists in the games code or is developed after the game is released expansions add new maps missions weapons and other things that werent previously accessible in the original game an example of an expansion is bungie s destiny which had the rise of iron expansion the expansion added new weapons new maps and higher levels and remade old missions expansions are added to the base game to help prolong the life of the game itself until the company is able to produce a sequel or a new game altogether developers may plan out their games life and already have the code for the expansion in the game but inaccessible by players who later unlock these expansions sometimes for free and sometimes at an extra cost some developers make games and add expansions later so that they could see what additions the players would like to have there are also expansions that are set apart from the original game and are considered a stand-alone game such as ubisoft s expansion assassins creed iv black flag freedoms cry which features a different character than the original game modifications main article mod computer gaming many games produced for the pc are designed such that technically oriented consumers can modify the game these mods can add an extra dimension of replayability and interest developers such as id software valve corporation crytek bethesda epic games and blizzard entertainment ship their games with some of the development tools used to make the game along with documentation to assist mod developers the internet provides an inexpensive medium to promote and distribute mods and they may be a factor in the commercial success of some games this allows for the kind of success seen by popular mods such as the half-life mod counter-strike cheating main article cheating video games cheating in computer games may involve cheat codes and hidden spots implemented by the game developers modification of game code by third parties or players exploiting a software glitch modifications are facilitated by either cheat cartridge hardware or a software trainer cheats usually make the game easier by providing an unlimited amount of some resource for example weapons health or ammunition or perhaps the ability to walk through walls other cheats might give access to otherwise unplayable levels or provide unusual or amusing features like altered game colors or other graphical appearances glitches main article glitch software errors not detected by software testers during development can find their way into released versions of computer and video games this may happen because the glitch only occurs under unusual circumstances in the game was deemed too minor to correct or because the game development was hurried to meet a publication deadline glitches can range from minor graphical errors to serious bugs that can delete saved data or cause the game to malfunction in some cases publishers will release updates referred to as patches to repair glitches sometimes a glitch may be beneficial to the player these are often referred to as exploits easter eggs easter eggs are hidden messages or jokes left in games by developers that are not part of the main game easter eggs are secret responses that occur as a result of an undocumented set of commands the results can vary from a simple printed message or image to a page of programmer credits or a small videogame hidden inside an otherwise serious piece of software videogame cheat codes are a specific type of easter egg in which entering a secret command will unlock special powers or new levels for the player theory main article game studies although departments of computer science have been studying the technical aspects of video games for years theories that examine games as an artistic medium are a relatively recent development in the humanities the two most visible schools in this emerging field are ludology and narratology narrativists approach video games in the context of what janet murray calls cyberdrama that is to say their major concern is with video games as a storytelling medium one that arises out of interactive fiction murray puts video games in the context of the holodeck a fictional piece of technology from star trek arguing for the video game as a medium in which the player is allowed to become another person and to act out in another world this image of video games received early widespread popular support and forms the basis of films such as tron existenz and the last starfighter ludologists break sharply and radically from this idea they argue that a video game is first and foremost a game which must be understood in terms of its rules interface and the concept of play that it deploys espen j aarseth argues that although games certainly have plots characters and aspects of traditional narratives these aspects are incidental to gameplay for example aarseth is critical of the widespread attention that narrativists have given to the heroine of the game tomb raider saying that the dimensions of lara croft s body already analyzed to death by film theorists are irrelevant to me as a player because a different-looking body would not make me play differently when i play i dont even see her body but see through it and past it simply put ludologists reject traditional theories of art because they claim that the artistic and socially relevant qualities of a video game are primarily determined by the underlying set of rules demands and expectations imposed on the player while many games rely on emergent principles video games commonly present simulated story worlds where emergent behavior occurs within the context of the game the term emergent narrative has been used to describe how in a simulated environment storyline can be created simply by what happens to the player however emergent behavior is not limited to sophisticated games in general any place where event-driven instructions occur for ai in a game emergent behavior will exist for instance take a racing game in which cars are programmed to avoid crashing and they encounter an obstacle in the track the cars might then maneuver to avoid the obstacle causing the cars behind them to slow and or maneuver to accommodate the cars in front of them and the obstacle the programmer never wrote code to specifically create a traffic jam yet one now exists in the game emulation main article video game console emulator project64 a nintendo 64 emulator running star fox 64 on a windows 8 platform an emulator is a program that replicates the behavior of a video game console allowing games to run on a different platform from the original hardware emulators exist for pcs smartphones and consoles other than the original emulators are generally used to play old games hack existing games translate unreleased games in a specific region or add enhanced features to games like improved graphics speed up or down bypass regional lockouts or online multiplayer support some manufacturers have released official emulators for their own consoles for example the virtual console allows users to play games for old nintendo consoles on the wii wii u and 3ds virtual console is part of nintendos strategy for deterring video game piracy in november 2015 microsoft launched backwards compatibility of xbox 360 games on xbox one console via emulation also sony announced relaunching ps2 games on ps4 via emulation according to sony computer entertainment america v bleem creating an emulator for a proprietary video game console is legal however nintendo claims that emulators promote the distribution of illegally copied games social aspects demographics see also gamer demographics the november 2005 nielsen active gamer study taking a survey of 2,000 regular gamers found that the u s games market is diversifying the age group among male players has expanded significantly in the 25 40 age group for casual online puzzle-style and simple mobile cell phone games the gender divide is more or less equal between men and women more recently there has been a growing segment of female players engaged with the aggressive style of games historically considered to fall within traditionally male genres e g first-person shooters according to the esrb almost 41% of pc gamers are women participation among african-americans is lower one survey of over 2000 game developers returned responses from only 2.5% who identified as black see also women and video games see also race and video games when comparing todays industry climate with that of 20 years ago women and many adults are more inclined to be using products in the industry while the market for teen and young adult men is still a strong market it is the other demographics which are posting significant growth the entertainment software association esa provides the following summary for 2011 based on a study of almost 1,200 american households carried out by ipsos mediact the average gamer is 30 years old and has been playing for 12 years eighty-two percent of gamers are 18 years of age or older forty-two percent of all players are women and women over 18 years of age are one of the industrys fastest growing demographics twenty-nine percent of game players are over the age of 50 an increase from nine percent in 1999 sixty-five percent of gamers play games with other gamers in person fifty-five percent of gamers play games on their phones or handheld device a 2006 academic study based on a survey answered by 10,000 gamers identified the gaymers gamers that identify as gay as a demographic group a follow-up survey in 2009 studied the purchase habits and content preferences of people in the group based on the study by npd group in 2011 approximately 91 percent of children aged 2 17 play games culture main article video game culture video game culture is a worldwide new media subculture formed around video games and game playing as computer and video games have increased in popularity over time they have had a significant influence on popular culture video game culture has also evolved over time hand in hand with internet culture as well as the increasing popularity of mobile games many people who play video games identify as gamers which can mean anything from someone who enjoys games to someone who is passionate about it as video games become more social with multiplayer and online capability gamers find themselves in growing social networks gaming can both be entertainment as well as competition as a new trend known as electronic sports is becoming more widely accepted in the 2010s video games and discussions of video game trends and topics can be seen in social media politics television film and music multiplayer main article multiplayer video game video gaming has traditionally been a social experience multiplayer video games are those that can be played either competitively sometimes in electronic sports or cooperatively by using either multiple input devices or by hotseating tennis for two arguably the first video game was a two player game as was its successor pong the first commercially available game console the magnavox odyssey had two controller inputs since then most consoles have been shipped with two or four controller inputs some have had the ability to expand to four eight or as many as 12 inputs with additional adapters such as the multitap multiplayer arcade games typically feature play for two to four players sometimes tilting the monitor on its back for a top-down viewing experience allowing players to sit opposite one another many early computer games for non-pc descendant based platforms featured multiplayer support personal computer systems from atari and commodore both regularly featured at least two game ports pc-based computer games started with a lower availability of multiplayer options because of technical limitations pcs typically had either one or no game ports at all network games for these early personal computers were generally limited to only text based adventures or muds that were played remotely on a dedicated server this was due both to the slow speed of modems 300-1200-bit s and the prohibitive cost involved with putting a computer online in such a way where multiple visitors could make use of it however with the advent of widespread local area networking technologies and internet based online capabilities the number of players in modern games can be 32 or higher sometimes featuring integrated text and or voice chat massively multiplayer online game mmos can offer extremely high numbers of simultaneous players eve online set a record with 65,303 players on a single server in 2013 behavioral effects main article video game behavioral effects it has been shown that action video game players have better hand–eye coordination and visuo-motor skills such as their resistance to distraction their sensitivity to information in the peripheral vision and their ability to count briefly presented objects than nonplayers researchers found that such enhanced abilities could be acquired by training with action games involving challenges that switch attention between different locations but not with games requiring concentration on single objects it has been suggested by a few studies that online offline video gaming can be used as a therapeutic tool in the treatment of different mental health concerns in steven johnson s book everything bad is good for you he argues that video games in fact demand far more from a player than traditional games like monopoly to experience the game the player must first determine the objectives as well as how to complete them they must then learn the game controls and how the human-machine interface works including menus and huds beyond such skills which after some time become quite fundamental and are taken for granted by many gamers video games are based upon the player navigating and eventually mastering a highly complex system with many variables this requires a strong analytical ability as well as flexibility and adaptability he argues that the process of learning the boundaries goals and controls of a given game is often a highly demanding one that calls on many different areas of cognitive function indeed most games require a great deal of patience and focus from the player and contrary to the popular perception that games provide instant gratification games actually delay gratification far longer than other forms of entertainment such as film or even many books some research suggests video games may even increase players attention capacities learning principles found in video games have been identified as possible techniques with which to reform the u s education system it has been noticed that gamers adopt an attitude while playing that is of such high concentration they do not realize they are learning and that if the same attitude could be adopted at school education would enjoy significant benefits students are found to be learning by doing while playing video games while fostering creative thinking the u s army has deployed machines such as the packbot and uav vehicles which make use of a game-style hand controller to make it more familiar for young people according to research discussed at the 2008 convention of the american psychological association certain types of video games can improve the gamers dexterity as well as their ability to do problem solving a study of 33 laparoscopic surgeons found that those who played video games were 27 percent faster at advanced surgical procedures and made 37 percent fewer errors compared to those who did not play video games a second study of 303 laparoscopic surgeons 82 percent men 18 percent women also showed that surgeons who played video games requiring spatial skills and hand dexterity and then performed a drill testing these skills were significantly faster at their first attempt and across all 10 trials than the surgeons who did not play the video games first an experiment carried out by richard de lisi and jennifer woldorf demonstrates the positive effect that video games may have on spatial skills de lisi and woldorf took two groups of third graders one control group and one experiment group both groups took a paper-and-pencil test of mental rotation skills after this test the experiment group only played 11 sessions of the game tetris this game was chosen as it requires mental rotation after this game both groups took the test again the result showed that the scores of the experiment group raised higher than that of the control group thereby confirming this theory the research showing benefits from action games has been questioned due to methodological shortcomings such as recruitment strategies and selection bias potential placebo effects and lack of baseline improvements in control groups in addition many of the studies are cross-sectional and of the longitudinal interventional trials not all have found effects a response to this pointed out that the skill improvements from action games are more broad than predicted such as mental rotation which is not a common task in action games action gamers are not only better at ignoring distractions but also at focusing on the main task objections to video games main article video game controversies like other media such as rock music notably heavy metal music and gangsta rap video games have been the subject of objections controversies and censorship for instance because of depictions of violence criminal activities sexual themes alcohol tobacco and other drugs propaganda profanity or advertisements critics of video games include parents groups politicians religious groups scientists and other advocacy groups claims that some video games cause addiction or violent behavior continue to be made and to be disputed there have been a number of societal and scientific arguments about whether the content of video games change the behavior and attitudes of a player and whether this is reflected in video game culture overall since the early 1980s advocates of video games have emphasized their use as an expressive medium arguing for their protection under the laws governing freedom of speech and also as an educational tool detractors argue that video games are harmful and therefore should be subject to legislative oversight and restrictions the positive and negative characteristics and effects of video games are the subject of scientific study results of investigations into links between video games and addiction aggression violence social development and a variety of stereotyping and sexual morality issues are debated a study was done that showed that young people who have had a greater exposure to violence in video games ended up behaving more aggressively towards people in a social environment possible benefits in spite of the negative effects of video games certain studies indicate that they may have value in terms of academic performance perhaps because of the skills that are developed in the process when you play games you re solving puzzles to move to the next level and that involves using some of the general knowledge and skills in maths reading and science that you ve been taught during the day said alberto posso an associate professor at the royal melbourne institute of technology after analysing data from the results of standardized testing completed by over 12,000 high school students across australia as summarized by the guardian the study published in the international journal of communication found that students who played online games almost every day scored 15 points above average in maths and reading tests and 17 points above average in science however the reporter added an important comment that was not

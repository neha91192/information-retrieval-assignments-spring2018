the first movie stars in the early days of silent movies the names of the actors and actresses appearing in them were not publicized or credited because producers feared this would result in demands for higher salaries however audience curiosity soon undermined this policy by 1909 actresses such as florence lawrence and mary pickford were already widely recognized although the public remained

developed a massive industrial enterprise that peddled a new intangibleâ€”fame early hollywood studios tightly controlled who was a movie star as only they had the ability to place stars names above the title according to film historian jeanine basinger this was done only for economic reasons hollywood image makers and promotional agents planted rumors selectively released real or fictitious biographical information to the press and used other gimmicks to create glamorous personas for actors publicists thus created the enduring images and public perceptions of screen legends such as judy garland rock hudson marilyn monroe and grace kelly the development of this star system made fame something that could be fabricated purposely by the masters of the new machinery of glory however regardless of how strenuously the star and their media handlers and press agents may try to monitor and shape it the media and the public always play a substantial part in the image-making process according to madow fame is a relational phenomenon something that is conferred by others a person can within the limits of his natural talents make himself strong or swift or learned but he cannot in this same sense make himself famous any more than he can make himself loved madow goes on to point out fame is often conferred or withheld just as love is for reasons and on grounds other than merit according to sofia johansson the canonical texts on stardom include articles by boorstin 1971 alberoni 1972 and dyer 1979 that examined the representations of stars and on aspects of the hollywood star system johansson writes that more recent analyses within media and cultural studies e g gamson 1994 marshall 1997 giles 2000 turner marshall and bonner 2000 rojek 2001 turner 2004 have instead dealt with the idea of a pervasive contemporary celebrity culture in the analysis of the celebrity culture fame and its constituencies are conceived of as a broader social process connected to widespread economic political technological and cultural developments in the 1980s and 1990s entertainment companies began using stars for a range of publicity tactics including press releases movie junkets and community activities these promotional efforts are targeted and designed using market research to increase the predictability of success of their media ventures in some cases publicity

baseball theres something about the nature of that kind of pressure where youre coming in at the ninth inning and throwing your fastball to three batters and leaving thats exhilarating attanasio is quoted as saying from an article in the la times in 2002 al boasberg 1891 1937 the general 1926 and a night at the opera 1935 carrie fisher 1956 2016 hook 1991 sister act 1992 lethal weapon 3 1992

still working as a script doctor in december 2008 she said i havent done it for a few years i did it for many years and then younger people came to do it and i started to do new things it was a long very lucrative episode of my life but its complicated to do that now its all changed actually now in order to get a rewrite job you have to submit your notes for your ideas on how to fix the script so they can get all the notes from all the different writers keep the notes and not hire you thats free work and thats what i always call life-wasting events ben hecht 1894 1964 twentieth century 1934 a

at the algonquin with dorothy parker it suited him to downplay his movie work so he only received credit for about half of the 100 plus films he worked on tom mankiewicz 1942 2010 the deep 1977 the spy who loved me 1977 superman 1978 moonraker 1979 and superman ii 1980 he was credited as creative consultant on superman by director richard donner in a june 2012 interview robert crane who co-wrote mankiewiczs autobiography my life as a mankiewicz 2012 said i think script doctoring was an in road for him people had liked what theyd seen with the bond films especially the dialogue i think that caught the attention of agents and studio heads and they said i want mankiewicz to come in here and work on this project he spent a lot of time at warner brothers and universal working on scripts elaine may born 1932 reds 1981 tootsie 1982 and labyrinth 1986 john sayles born 1950 apollo 13 1995 mimic 1997 sayles has stated that the script doctors main role is to help others tell their stories he decides which jobs to accept based on whether there is a germ of an idea for a movie he would actually like to see he has also stated that he works harder when writing for others than he does on his own work aaron sorkin born 1961 schindlers list 1993 the rock 1996 excess baggage 1997 and enemy of the state 1998 in an october 2010 interview he said with the script doctoring i did it for jerry bruckheimer for a while because i was just going through a period where i was having a very difficult time coming up with my own ideas and i was climbing the walls so i did what is called the production polish where you are brought into the last two weeks on something that you are not emotionally invested in where it is not your job to break the story to come up with the moving parts and plot points basically they just wanted some snappy dialogue for sean connery and nicolas cage the first time i did it actually was for schindlers list where no-one is looking for snappy dialogue but the writer of that movie had gone on to direct a picture and there was a little more work that director steven spielberg wanted done before it went to poland to begin shooting he asked me to come in and do that but you are obviously more interested in your own thing sir tom stoppard born 1937 indiana jones and the last crusade 1989 sleepy hollow 1999 and the bourne ultimatum 2007 on the bourne ultimatum stoppard said in october 2007 i wrote a script for director paul greengrass some of the themes are still mineâ€”but i dont think theres a single word of mine in the film according to an april 2010 interview with the guardian stoppard does uncredited script-doctoring on hollywood movies about once a year most recently he worked on paul greengrasss the bourne ultimatum the second reason for doing it is that you get to work with people you admire the first reason of course is that its overpaid once hearing the phone ring at home while in the shower he took a call from director steven spielberg on the set of schindlers list agonising over a scene in steven zaillian s script standing naked stoppard improvised a solution that was used in the movie he remains bemused by this american habit of invisible script revision i actually got quite angry with spielberg who was and is a good friend and told him just to film zaillians script but steven like a lot of other people in movies tends to think one more opinion cant hurt he also said i used to worry about it enormously but its a different culture its a moral issue almost a few years ago i was invited to a film festival as a freebie because id done so much work on a movie that they said i should be there and i said i cant do that because im not supposed to be on this film and its unfair to the chap whose name is on it but it just goes with the territory these are the conditions one works under out there quentin tarantino born 1963 its pat 1994 and crimson tide 1995 robert towne born 1934 bonnie and clyde 1967 the godfather 1972 and armageddon 1998 author peter biskind writes in easy riders raging bulls 1998 that francis ford coppola asked towne if he wanted credit for his contributions to the screenplay of the godfather and towne replied dont be ridiculous i only wrote a couple of fuckin scenes if you win an oscar thank me coppola won the academy award for best writing adapted screenplay and thanked towne joss whedon born 1964 speed 1994 the quick and the dead 1995 waterworld 1995 twister 1996 and x-men 2000 in a september 2001 interview whedon said most of the dialogue in speed is mine and a bunch of the characters adding that he was arbitrated out of credit he also spoke about waterworld and x-men i refer to myself as the worlds highest-paid stenographer this is a situation ive been in a bunch of times waterworld was a good idea and the script was the classic they have a good idea then they write a generic script and dont really care about the idea when i was brought in there was no water in the last 40 pages of the script it all took place on land or on a ship or whatever im like isnt the cool thing about this guy that he has gills and no one was listening i was there basically taking notes from kevin costner who was very nice fine to work with but he was not a writer and he had written a bunch of stuff that they wouldnt let their staff touch so i was supposed to be there for a week and i was there for seven weeks and i accomplished nothing i wrote a few puns and a few scenes that i cant even sit through because they came out so bad it was the same situation with x-men they said come in and punch up the big climax the third act and if you can make it cheaper that was the mandate on both movies and my response to both movies was the problem with the third act is the first two acts but again no one was paying attention and then in x-men not only did they throw out my script and never tell me about it they actually invited me to the read-through having thrown out my entire draft without telling me

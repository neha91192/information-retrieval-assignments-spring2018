etymology edit main article names of buenos aires aldus verthoont hem de stadt buenos ayrros geleegen in rio de la plata painting by a dutch sailor who anchored at the port around 1628 it is recorded under the archives of aragonese that catalan missionaries and jesuits arriving in cagliari sardinia under the spanish crown after its capture from the pisans in 1324 established their headquarters on top of a hill that overlooked the city the hill was known to them as buen ayre or bonaria in sardinian language as it was free of the foul smell prevalent in the old city the castle area which is adjacent to swampland during the siege of cagliari the aragonese built a sanctuary to the virgin mary on top of the hill in 1335 king alfonso the gentle donated the church to the mercedarians who built an abbey that stands to this day in the years after that a story circulated claiming that a statue of the virgin mary was retrieved from the sea after it miraculously helped to calm a storm in the mediterranean sea the statue was placed in the abbey spanish sailors especially andalusians venerated this image and frequently invoked the fair winds to aid them in their navigation and prevent shipwrecks a sanctuary to the virgin of buen ayre would be later erected in seville in the first foundation of buenos aires spanish sailors arrived thankfully in the río de la plata by the blessings of the santa maria de los buenos aires the holy virgin mary of the good winds who was said to have given them the good winds to reach the coast of what is today the modern city of buenos aires pedro de mendoza called the city holy mary of the fair winds a name suggested by the chaplain of mendozas expedition a devotee of the virgin of buen ayre after the sardinian madonna de bonaria that is still to this day the patroness of sardinia mendoza s settlement soon came under attack by indigenous people and was abandoned in 1541 for many years the name was attributed to a sancho del campo who is said to have exclaimed how fair are the winds of this land as he arrived but eduardo madero in 1882 after conducting extensive research in spanish archives ultimately concluded that the name was indeed closely linked with the devotion of the sailors to our lady of buen ayre a second and permanent settlement was established in 1580 by juan de garay who sailed down the paraná river from asunción now the capital of paraguay garay preserved the name originally chosen by mendoza calling the city ciudad de la santísima trinidad y puerto de santa maría del buen aire city of the most holy trinity and port of saint mary of the fair winds the short form buenos aires became the common usage during the 17th century the usual abbreviation for buenos aires in spanish is bs as it is common as

spain was the first european to reach the río de la plata in 1516 his expedition was cut short when he was killed during an attack by the native charrúa tribe in what is now uruguay the city of buenos aires was first established as ciudad de nuestra señora santa maría del buen ayre literally city of our lady saint mary of the fair winds after our lady of bonaria patroness saint of sardinia on 2

attacks by the indigenous people forced the settlers away and in 1542 the site was abandoned a second and permanent settlement was established on 11 june 1580 by juan de garay who arrived by sailing down the paraná river from asunción now the capital of paraguay he dubbed the settlement santísima trinidad and its port became puerto de santa maría de los buenos aires from its earliest days buenos aires depended primarily on trade during most of the 17th century spanish ships were menaced by pirates so they developed a complex system where ships with military protection were dispatched to central america in a convoy from seville the only port allowed to trade with the colonies to lima peru and from it to the inner cities of the viceroyalty because of this products took a very long time to arrive in buenos aires and the taxes generated by the transport made them prohibitive this scheme frustrated the traders of buenos aires and a thriving informal yet accepted by the authorities contraband industry developed inside the colonies and with the portuguese this also instilled a deep resentment among porteños towards the spanish authorities sensing these feelings charles iii of spain progressively eased the trade restrictions and finally declared buenos aires an open port in the late 18th century the capture of porto bello by british forces also fueled the need to foster commerce via the atlantic route to the detriment of lima-based trade one of his rulings was to split a region from the viceroyalty of perú and create instead the viceroyalty of the río de la plata

peninsular war in spain an attempt by the peninsular merchant martín de álzaga to remove liniers and replace him with a junta was defeated by the criollo armies however by 1810 it would be those same

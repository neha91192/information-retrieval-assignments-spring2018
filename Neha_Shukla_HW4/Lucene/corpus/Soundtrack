soundtrack album of music as featured in the soundtrack of a film video or television presentation or the physical area of a film that contains the synchronized recorded sound origin of the term edit in movie industry terminology usage a sound track is an audio recording created or used in film production or post-production initially the dialogue sound effects and music in a film each has its own separate track dialogue track sound effects track and music track and these are mixed together to make what is called the composite track which is heard in the film a dubbing track is often later created when films are dubbed into another language this is also known as a m e track music and effects containing all sound elements minus dialogue which is then supplied by the foreign distributor in the native language of its territory the contraction soundtrack came into public consciousness with the advent of so-called soundtrack albums in the late 1940s first conceived by movie companies as a promotional gimmick for new films these commercially available recordings were labeled and advertised as music from the original motion picture soundtrack or music from and inspired by the motion picture these phrases were soon shortened to just original motion picture soundtrack more accurately such recordings are made from a films music track because they usually consist of the isolated music from a film not the composite sound track with dialogue and sound effects the abbreviation ost is often used to describe the musical soundtrack on a recorded medium such as cd and it stands for o riginal s ound t rack however it is sometimes also used to differentiate the original music heard and recorded versus a rerecording or cover of the music types of recordings edit types of soundtrack recordings include musical film soundtracks are for the film versions of musical theatre they concentrate primarily on the songs examples grease singin in the rain film scores showcase the primarily instrumental musical themes and background music from movies examples star wars the lord of the rings for movies that contain both orchestral film scores and pop songs both types of music albums of popular songs heard in whole or part in the background of non-musical movies examples sleepless in seattle when harry met sally video game soundtracks are often released after a games release usually consisting of the theme and background music from the games levels menus title screens promo material such as entire songs of which only segments were used in the game cut-screens and occasionally sound-effects used in the game examples sonic heroes the legend of zelda ocarina of time albums which contain both music and dialogue from the film such as the 1968 romeo and juliet or the first authentic soundtrack album of the wizard of oz the soundtrack to the 1937 walt disney animated film snow white and the seven dwarfs was the first commercially issued film soundtrack it was released by rca victor records on multiple 78 rpm discs in january 1938 as songs from walt disneys snow white and the seven dwarfs with the same characters and sound effects as in the film of that title and has since seen numerous expansions and reissues the first live-action musical film to have a commercially issued soundtrack album was mgm s 1946 film biography of show boat composer jerome kern till the clouds roll by the album was originally issued as a set of four 10-inch 78-rpm records only eight selections from the film were included in this first edition of the album in order to fit the songs onto the record sides the musical material needed editing and manipulation this was before tape existed so the record producer needed to copy segments from the playback discs used on set then copy and re-copy them from one disc to another adding transitions and cross-fades until the final master was created needless to say it was several generations removed from the original and the sound quality suffered for it the playback recordings were purposely recorded very dry without reverberation otherwise it would come across as too hollow sounding in large movie theatres this made these albums sound flat and boxy terminology edit mgm records called these original cast albums in the style of decca broadway show cast albums mostly because the material on the disc s would not lock to picture thereby creating the largest distinction between original motion picture soundtrack which in its strictest sense would contain music that would lock to picture if the home user would play one alongside the other and original cast soundtrack which in its strictest sense would refer to studio recordings of film music by the original film cast but which had been edited and or rearranged for time and content and would not lock to picture in reality however soundtrack producers remain ambiguous about this distinction and titles in which the music on the album does lock to picture may be labeled as ocs and music from an album that does not lock to picture may be referred to as omps the phrase recorded directly from the soundtrack was used for a while in the 1970s 1980s and 1990s to differentiate material that would lock to picture from that which would not excluding alternate masters and alternate vocals or solos but again in part because many film takes actually consisted of several different attempts at the song and edited together to form the master that term as well became nebulous and vague over time when in cases where the master take used in the film could not be found in its isolated form without the m e the aforementioned alternate masters and alternate vocal and solo performances which could be located were included in their place as a result of all this nebulosity over the years the term soundtrack began to be commonly applied to any recording from a film whether taken from the actual film soundtrack or re-recorded in the studio at an earlier or later time the phrase is also sometimes incorrectly used for broadway cast recordings while it is correct in some instances to call a soundtrack a cast recording since in most cases it contains performances recorded by the original film cast it is never correct to call a cast recording a soundtrack contributing to the vagueness of the term are projects such as the sound of music live which was filmed live on the set for an nbc holiday season special first broadcast in 2013 the album released three days before the broadcast contained studio pre-recordings of all the songs used in the special performed by the original cast therefrom but because only the orchestral portion of the material from the album is the same as that used in the special i e the vocals were sung live over a prerecorded track this creates a similar technicality because although the instrumental music bed from the cd will lock to picture the vocal performances will not although it is possible to create a complete soundtrack recording by lifting the vocal performances from the dvd erasing the alternate vocal masters from the cd and combining the two among mgms most notable soundtrack albums were those of the films good news easter parade annie get your gun singin in the rain show boat the band wagon seven brides for seven brothers and gigi film score albums edit film score albums did not really become popular until the lp era although a few were issued in 78-rpm albums alex north s score for the 1951 film version of a streetcar named desire was released on a 10-inch lp by capitol records and sold so well that the label later re-released it on one side of a 12-inch lp with some of max steiner s film music on the reverse steiner s score for gone with the wind has been recorded many times but when the film was reissued in 1967 mgm records finally released an album of the famous score recorded directly from the soundtrack like the 1967 re-release of the film this version of the score was artificially enhanced for stereo in recent years rhino records has released a 2-cd set of the complete gone with the wind score restored to its original mono sound one of the biggest-selling film scores of all time was john williams music from the movie star wars many film score albums go out-of-print after the films finish their theatrical runs and some have become extremely rare collectors items composite film tracks included on record edit in a few rare instances an entire film dialogue track was issued on records the 1968 franco zeffirelli film of romeo and juliet was issued as a 4-lp set as a single lp with musical and dialogue excerpts and as an album containing only the films musical score the ground-breaking film whos afraid of virginia woolf was issued by warner bros records as a 2-lp set containing virtually all the dialogue from the film rca victor also issued a double-album set what was virtually all the dialogue from the film soundtrack of a man for all seasons decca

melodies starting in the late 1980s and the soundtracks to popular games such as the dragon quest and final fantasy series began to be released separately in addition to compositions written specifically for video games the advent of cd technology allowed developers to incorporate licensed songs into their soundtrack the grand theft auto series is a good example of this furthermore when

large costumes where their faces may be obscured they mime along to a prerecorded music effects and narration track that may sound as if it was lifted from a movie or may sound as if it had been overly dramatized for effect in the case of cruise ships the small stage spaces do not allow for full orchestration so that possibly the larger instruments may be pre-recorded onto a backing track and the remaining instruments may play live or the reverse may occur in such instances as elvis the concert or sinatra his voice his world his way both of which use isolated vocal and video performances

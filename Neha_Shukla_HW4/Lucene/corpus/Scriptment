scriptment wikipedia a scriptment is a written work by a movie or television screenwriter that combines elements of a script and treatment especially the dialogue elements which are formatted the same as in a screenplay it is a more elaborate document than a standard draft treatment some films have been shot using only a scriptment origin edit the term scriptment was originally coined by filmmaker james cameron possibly during his early involvement in the development of the spider-man film series in that effort after the success of his 1984 film the terminator cameron wrote a 57-page scriptment for the first proposed spider-man film which was used by screenwriter david koepp to write the first draft incorporating it nearly word for word camerons scriptment for titanic 1997 was 131 pages the term became more widely known when camerons 1994 scriptment for the 2009 film avatar was leaked on the internet during pre-production although other directors such as john hughes and zak penn had written scriptments before the scriptment for avatar 2009 and its notoriety caused the spread of the term elements edit a scriptment borrows characteristics from both a regular screenplay and a film treatment and is comparable to a step outline the main text body is similar to an elaborate draft treatment while usually only major sequences receive scene location headings slug lines which is different from the extensive slug line formatting in standard screenplays where every new scene or shot begins with an int  ext day night slug line set above the description or dialogue however just as a treatment can be short or long a scriptment can exist in various degrees of completion depending on how much time the writer has devoted to it and a more fully developed one could have all slug lines in place a great deal of dialogue and only require the producers or a writing partners okay on the direction the finished script should take before proceeding further in a scriptment scenes and shots may be separated as paragraphs or sentences and if it is the writers style can also include an occasional explanatory note such as might be important in an adaptation or a sequel as with standard treatments much of the dialogue is summarized in action the longer the scriptment however the more likely it contains dialog scenes that are fully developed single words or brief phrases of dialogue can be included within the description and lengthier exchanges are formatted exactly as a regular screenplay which is the main reason for the script part of the term the longer the scriptment the more likely it is written shot to shot as opposed to scene by scene thus a long detailed scriptment does not necessarily equate to a longer movie as a typical 90 120 page screenplay written with master scenes contains many more individual shots than are immediately apparent a scriptment can begin with fade in top left and conclude with a centered the end it can have a title page like a script and lengthier treatment it is written single spaced with an empty space between paragraphs and other elements and the pages are numbered in the upper right corner just as in a screenplay work-in-progress manuscript edit directors and screenwriters write scriptments as an intermediate stage in development from the draft treatment to the first draft of the screenplay like a draft treatment a scriptment can be anywhere from 20 to 80 or more pages while regular presentation treatments or outlines only summarize the plot typically in not more than 30 pages for the batman feature

the world the first film serial ever the million dollar mystery was released by the thanhouser company in 1914 in the early 1900s companies started moving to los angeles california although electric lights were by then widely available none were yet powerful enough to adequately expose film the best source of illumination for motion picture production was natural sunlight some movies were shot on the roofs of buildings in downtown los angeles early movie producers also relocated to southern california to escape edisons motion picture patents company which controlled almost all the patents

valley the majors edit further information major film studio the big 5 by the mid-1920s the evolution of a handful of american production companies into wealthy motion picture industry conglomerates that owned their own studios distribution divisions and theaters and contracted with performers and other filmmaking personnel led to the sometimes confusing equation of studio with production company in industry slang five large companies 20th century fox rko pictures paramount pictures warner bros and metro-goldwyn-mayer came to be known as the big five the majors or the studios in trade publications such as variety and their management structures and practices collectively came to be known as the studio system the little 3 although they owned few or no theaters to guarantee sales of their films universal pictures columbia pictures and united artists also fell under these rubrics making a total of eight generally recognized major studios united artists although its controlling partners owned not one but two production studios during the golden age had an often-tenuous hold on the title of major and operated mainly as a backer and distributor of independently produced films the minors edit smaller studios operated simultaneously with the majors these included operations such as republic pictures active from 1935 which produced films that occasionally matched the scale and ambition of the larger studio and monogram pictures which specialized in series and genre releases together with smaller outfits such as prc tko and grand national the minor studios filled the demand for b movies and are sometimes collectively referred to as poverty row the independents edit the big fives ownership of movie theaters was eventually opposed by eight independent producers including samuel goldwyn david o selznick walt disney hal roach and walter wanger in 1948 the federal government won a case against paramount in the supreme court which ruled that the vertically integrated structure of the movie industry constituted an illegal monopoly this decision reached after twelve years of litigation hastened the end of the studio system and hollywoods golden age typical major film studio components edit by the 1950s the physical components of a typical major film studio had become standardized since then a major film studio has usually been housed inside a physically secure compound with a high wall which protects filmmaking operations from unwanted interference from paparazzi and crazed fans of leading movie stars movement in and out of the studio is normally limited to specific gates often capped with grand decorative arches where visitors must stop at a boom barrier and explain the purpose of their visit to a security guard studio premises generally feature multiple sound stages along with an outside backlot as well as offices for studio executives and production companies there is normally a studio commissary which is the traditional term in the film industry for what other industries call a company cafeteria early nitrate film was notoriously flammable and sets were and are still very flammable which is why film studios built in the early-to-mid 20th century have water towers to facilitate firefighting film to television edit halfway through the 1950s with television proving to be a lucrative enterprise not destined to disappear any time soon—as many in the film industry had once hoped—movie studios were increasingly being used to produce programming for the burgeoning medium some midsize film companies such as republic pictures eventually sold their studios to tv production concerns which were eventually bought by larger studios such as the american broadcasting company which was purchased by the walt disney company in 1996 today edit with the growing diversification of studios into such fields as video games television theme parks home video and publishing they have become multi-national corporations as the studios increased in size they began to rely on production companies like j j abrams bad robot productions to handle many of the creative and physical production details of their feature films instead the studios transformed into financing and distribution entities for the films made by their affiliated production companies with the decreasing cost of cg and visual effects many studios sold large chunks of their once massive studio spaces or backlots to private real-estate developers century city in los angeles was once part of the 20th century fox backlot which was among the largest and most famous of the studio lots in most cases portions of the backlots were retained and are available for rental by various film and television productions some studios offer tours of their backlots while universal pictures allows visitors to its adjacent universal studios hollywood theme park to take a tram tour of the backlot where films such as psycho and back to the future were once shot independent film and the studios edit in the 1980s and 90s as the cost of professional 16mm film equipment decreased along with the emergence of non-film innovations such as s-vhs and mini-dv cameras many young filmmakers began to make films outside the studio system filmmakers such as jim jarmusch robert rodriguez steven soderbergh quentin tarantino kevin smith and richard linklater made films that pushed boundaries in ways the studios were then reluctant to do in response to these films many distributed by mini-studios like miramax the majors created their own in-house mini-studios meant to focus on edgier independent content focus features was created by universal pictures and fox searchlight was created by 20th century fox for this purpose notable film

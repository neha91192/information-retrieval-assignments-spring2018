labor union us is an organization of workers who have come together to achieve common goals such as protecting the integrity of its trade improving safety standards and attaining better wages benefits such as vacation health care and retirement and working conditions through the increased bargaining power wielded by the creation of a monopoly of the workers the trade union through its leadership bargains with the employer on behalf of union members rank and file members and negotiates labour contracts collective bargaining with employers the most common purpose of these associations or unions is maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment this may include the negotiation of wages work rules complaint procedures rules governing hiring firing and promotion of workers benefits workplace safety and policies unions may organize a particular section of skilled workers craft unionism a cross-section of workers from various trades general unionism or attempt to organize all workers within a particular industry industrial unionism the agreements negotiated by a union are binding on the rank and file members and the employer and in some cases on other non-member workers trade unions traditionally have a constitution which details the governance of their bargaining unit and also have governance at various levels of government depending on the industry that binds them legally to their negotiations and functioning originating in great britain trade unions became popular in many countries during the industrial revolution trade unions may be composed of individual workers professionals past workers students apprentices or the unemployed trade union density or the percentage of workers belonging to a trade union is highest in the nordic countries definition edit since the publication of the history of trade unionism 1894 by sidney and beatrice webb the predominant historical view is that a trade union is a continuous association of wage earners for the purpose of maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment karl marx described trade unions thus the value of labour-power constitutes the conscious and explicit foundation of the trade unions whose importance for the working class can scarcely be overestimated the trade unions aim at nothing less than to prevent the reduction of wages below the level that is traditionally maintained in the various branches of industry that is to say they wish to prevent the price of labour-power from falling below its value capital v1 1867 p 1069 a modern definition by the australian bureau of statistics states that a trade union is an organization consisting predominantly of employees the principal activities of which include the negotiation of rates of pay and conditions of employment for its members yet historian r a leeson in united we stand 1971 said two conflicting views of the trade-union movement strove for ascendancy in the nineteenth century one the defensive-restrictive guild-craft tradition passed down through journeymens clubs and friendly societies the other the aggressive-expansionist drive to unite all labouring men and women for a different order of things recent historical research by bob james in craft trade or mystery 2001 puts forward the view that trade unions are part of a broader movement of benefit societies which includes medieval guilds freemasons oddfellows friendly societies and other fraternal organizations the 18th century economist adam smith noted the imbalance in the rights of workers in regards to owners or masters in the wealth of nations book i chapter 8 smith wrote we rarely hear it has been said of the combination of masters though frequently of those of workmen but whoever imagines upon this account that masters rarely combine is as ignorant of the world as of the subject masters are always and everywhere in a sort of tacit but constant and uniform combination not to raise the wages of labor above their actual rate when workers combine masters never cease to call aloud for the assistance of the civil magistrate and the rigorous execution of those laws which have been enacted with so much severity against the combination of servants labourers and journeymen as smith noted unions were illegal for many years in most countries although smith argued that it should remain illegal to fix wages or prices by employees or employers there were severe penalties for attempting to organize unions up to and including execution despite this unions were formed and began to acquire political power eventually resulting in a body of labour law that not only legalized organizing efforts but codified the relationship between employers and those employees organized into unions history edit early 19th century workplace militancy manifested in the luddite riots when unemployed workers destroyed labour saving machines the origins of trade unions can be traced back to 18th century britain where the rapid expansion of industrial society then taking place drew women children rural workers and immigrants into the work force in large numbers and in new roles this pool of unskilled and semi-skilled labour spontaneously organized in fits and starts throughout its beginnings and would later be an important arena for the development of trade unions trade unions have sometimes been seen as successors to the guilds of medieval europe though the relationship between the two is disputed as the masters of the guilds employed workers apprentices and journeymen who were not allowed to organize trade unions and collective bargaining were outlawed from no later than the middle of the 14th century when the ordinance of labourers was enacted in the kingdom of england as collective bargaining and early worker unions grew with the onset of the industrial revolution the government began to clamp down on what it saw as the danger of popular unrest at the time of the napoleonic wars in 1799 the combination act was passed which banned trade unions and collective bargaining by british workers although the unions were subject to often severe repression until 1824 they were already widespread in cities such as london workplace militancy had also manifested itself as luddism and had been prominent in struggles such as the 1820 rising in scotland in which 60,000 workers went on a general strike which was soon crushed sympathy for the plight of the workers brought repeal of the acts in 1824 although the combination act 1825 severely restricted their activity by the 1810s the first labour organizations to bring together workers of divergent occupations were formed possibly the first such union was the general union of trades also known as the philanthropic society founded in 1818 in manchester the latter name was to hide the organizations real purpose in a time when trade unions were still illegal national general unions edit poster issued by the london trades council advertising a demonstration held on june 2 1873 the first attempts at setting up a national general union were made in the 1820s and 30s the national association for the protection of labour was established in 1830 by john doherty after an apparently unsuccessful attempt to create a similar national presence with the national union of cotton-spinners the association quickly enrolled approximately 150 unions consisting mostly of textile related unions but also including mechanics blacksmiths and various others membership rose to between 10,000 and 20,000 individuals spread across the five counties of lancashire cheshire derbyshire nottinghamshire and leicestershire within a year to establish awareness and legitimacy the union started the weekly voice of the people publication having the declared intention to unite the productive classes of the community in one common bond of union in 1834 the welsh socialist robert owen established the grand national consolidated trades union the organization attracted a range of socialists from owenites to revolutionaries and played a part in the protests after the tolpuddle martyrs case but soon collapsed more permanent trade unions were established from the 1850s better resourced but often less radical the london trades council was founded in 1860 and the sheffield outrages spurred the establishment of the trades union congress in 1868 the first long-lived national trade union center by this time the existence and the demands of the trade unions were becoming accepted by liberal middle class opinion in principles of political economy 1871 john stuart mill wrote if it were possible for the working classes by combining among themselves to raise or keep up the general rate of wages it needs hardly be said that this would be a thing not to be punished but to be welcomed and rejoiced at unfortunately the effect is quite beyond attainment by such means the multitudes who compose the working class are too numerous and too widely scattered to combine at all much more to combine effectually if they could do so they might doubtless succeed in diminishing the hours of labour and obtaining the same wages for less work they would also have a limited power of obtaining by combination an increase of general wages at the expense of profits legalization and expansion edit labour union demonstrators held at bay by soldiers during the 1912 lawrence textile strike in lawrence massachusetts trade unions were finally legalized in 1872 after a royal commission on trade unions in 1867 agreed that the establishment of the organizations was to the advantage of both employers and employees this period also saw the growth of trade unions in other industrializing countries especially the united states germany and france in the united states the first effective nationwide labour organization was the knights of labor in 1869 which began to grow after 1880 legalization occurred slowly as a result of a series of court decisions the federation of organized trades and labor unions began in 1881 as a federation of different unions that did not directly enrol workers in 1886 it became known as the american federation of labor or afl in germany the free association of german trade unions was formed in 1897 after the conservative anti-socialist laws of chancellor otto von bismarck were repealed in france labour organization was illegal until 1884 the bourse du travail was founded in 1887 and merged with the fédération nationale des syndicats national federation of trade unions in 1895 to form the general confederation of labour france prevalence edit the percentage of union election campaigns accompanied by illegal firings increased during the reagan administration the prevalence of unions in

trades halls opening in all cities and most regional towns in the following forty years during the 1880s trade unions developed among shearers miners and stevedores wharf workers but soon spread to

eight-hour day march circa 1900 outside parliament house in spring street melbourne australia gained a reputation as the working mans paradise some employers tried to undercut the unions by importing chinese labour this produced a reaction which led to all the colonies restricting chinese and other asian immigration this was the foundation of the white australia policy the australian compact based around centralised industrial arbitration a degree of government assistance particularly for primary industries and white australia was to continue for many years before gradually dissolving in the second half of the 20th century in the 1870s and 1880s the growing trade union movement began a series of protests against foreign labour their arguments were that asians and chinese took jobs away from white men worked for substandard wages lowered working conditions and refused unionisation objections to these arguments came largely from wealthy land owners in rural areas it was argued that without asiatics to work in the tropical areas of the northern territory and queensland the area would have to be abandoned despite these objections to restricting immigration between 1875 and 1888 all australian colonies enacted legislation which excluded all further chinese immigration asian immigrants already residing in the australian colonies were not expelled and retained the same rights as their anglo and southern compatriots the barton government which came to power following the first elections to the commonwealth parliament in 1901 was formed by the protectionist party with the support of the australian labor party the support of the labor party was contingent upon restricting non-white immigration reflecting the attitudes of the australian workers union and other labour

following a strike in windsor ontario involving 17,000 ford workers he granted the union the compulsory check-off of union dues rand ruled that all workers in a bargaining unit benefit from a

until the 1980s worldwide spread of neo-liberalism through the washington consensus the mexican unions did not operate independently but instead as part of a state institutional system largely controlled by the ruling party during these 40 years the primary aim of the labour unions was not to benefit the workers but to carry out the states economic policy under their cosy relationship with the ruling party this economic policy which peaked in the 1950s and 60s with the so-called mexican miracle saw rising incomes and improved standards of living but the primary beneficiaries were the wealthy in the 1980s mexico began adhering to washington consensus policies selling off state industries such as railroad and telecommunications to private industries the new owners had an antagonistic attitude towards unions which accustomed to comfortable relationships with the state were not prepared to fight back a movement of new unions began to emerge under a more independent model while the former institutionalized unions had become very corrupt violent and led by gangsters from the 1990s onwards this new model of independent unions prevailed a number of them represented

enterprise unions however join industry-wide federations which in turn are members of rengo the japanese national trade union confederation in western europe professional associations often carry out the functions of a trade union in these cases they may be negotiating for white-collar or professional workers such as physicians engineers or teachers typically such trade unions refrain from politics or pursue a more liberal politics than their blue-collar counterparts a union may acquire the status of a juristic person an artificial legal entity with a mandate to negotiate with employers for the workers it represents in such cases unions have certain legal rights most importantly the right to engage in collective bargaining with the employer or employers over wages working hours and other terms and conditions of employment the inability of the parties to reach an agreement may lead to industrial action culminating in either strike action or management lockout or binding arbitration in extreme cases violent or illegal activities may develop around these events the great southwest railroad strike of 1886 was a trade union strike involving more than 200,000 workers in other circumstances unions may not have the legal right to represent workers or the right may be in question this lack of status can range from non-recognition of a union to political or criminal prosecution of union activists and members with many cases of violence and deaths having been recorded historically unions may also engage in broader political or social struggle social unionism encompasses many unions that use their organizational strength to advocate for social policies and legislation favourable to their members or to workers in general as well unions in some countries are closely aligned with political parties unions are also delineated by the service model and the organizing model the service model union focuses more on maintaining worker rights providing services and resolving disputes alternately the organizing model typically involves full-time union organizers who work by building up confidence strong networks and leaders within the workforce and confrontational campaigns involving large numbers of union members many unions are a blend of these two philosophies and the definitions of the models themselves are still debated in britain the perceived left-leaning nature of trade unions has resulted in the formation of a reactionary right-wing trade union called solidarity which is supported by the far-right bnp in denmark there are some newer apolitical discount unions who offer a very basic level of services as opposed to the dominating danish pattern of extensive services and organizing a rally of the trade union unison in oxford during a strike on 28 march 2006 in contrast in several european countries e g belgium denmark the netherlands and switzerland religious unions have existed for decades these unions typically distanced themselves from some of the doctrines of orthodox marxism such as the preference of atheism and from rhetoric suggesting that employees interests always are in conflict with those of employers some of these christian unions have had some ties to centrist or conservative political movements and some do not regard strikes as acceptable political means for achieving employees goals in poland the biggest trade union solidarity emerged as an anti-communist movement with religious nationalist overtones and today it supports the right-wing law and justice party although their political structure and autonomy varies widely union leaderships are usually formed through democratic elections some research such as that conducted by the australian centre for industrial relations research and training argues that unionized workers enjoy better conditions and wages than those who are not unionized shop types edit companies that employ workers with a union generally operate on one of several models a closed shop us or a pre-entry closed shop uk employs only people who are already union members the compulsory hiring hall is an example of a closed shop in this case the employer must recruit directly from the union as well as the employee working strictly for unionized employers a union shop us or a post-entry closed shop uk employs non-union workers as well but sets a time limit within which new employees must join a union an agency shop requires non-union workers to pay a fee to the union for its services in negotiating their contract this is sometimes called the rand formula in certain situations involving state public employees in the united states such as california fair share laws make it easy to require these sorts of payments an open shop does not require union membership in employing or keeping workers where a union is active workers who do not contribute to a union may include those who approve of the union contract free riders and those who do not in the united states state level right-to-work laws mandate the open shop in some states in germany only open shops are legal that is all discrimination based on union membership is forbidden this affects the function and services of the union an eu case concerning italy stated that the principle of trade union freedom in the italian system implies recognition of the right of the individual not to belong to any trade union negative freedom of association trade union freedom and the unlawfulness of discrimination liable to cause harm to non-unionized employees in britain previous to this eu jurisprudence a series of laws introduced during the 1980s by margaret thatchers government restricted closed and union shops all agreements requiring a worker to join a union are now illegal in the united states the taft-hartley act of 1947 outlawed the closed shop in 2006 the european court of human rights found danish closed-shop agreements to be in breach of article 11 of the european convention on human rights and fundamental freedoms it was stressed that denmark and iceland were among a limited number of contracting states that continue to permit the conclusion of closed-shop agreements diversity of international unions edit union law varies from country to country as does the function of unions for example german and dutch unions have played a greater role in management decisions through participation in corporate boards and co-determination than have unions in the united states moreover in the united states collective bargaining is most commonly undertaken by unions directly with employers whereas in austria denmark germany or sweden unions most often negotiate with employers associations concerning labour market regulation in the eu gold 1993 and hall 1994 have identified three distinct systems of labour market regulation which also influence the role that unions play in the continental european system of labour market regulation the government plays an important role as there is a strong legislative core of employee rights which provides the basis for agreements as well as a framework for discord between unions on one side and employers or employers associations on the other this model was said to be found in eu core countries such as belgium france germany the netherlands and italy and it is also mirrored and emulated to some extent in the institutions of the eu due to the relative weight that these countries had in the eu until the eu expansion by the inclusion of 10 new eastern european member states in 2004 in the anglo-saxon system of labour market regulation the governments legislative role is much more limited which allows for more issues to be decided between employers and employees and any union or employers associations which might represent these parties in the decision-making process however in these countries collective agreements are not widespread only a few businesses and a few sectors of the economy have a strong tradition of finding collective solutions in labour relations ireland and the uk belong to this category and in contrast to the eu core countries above these countries first joined the eu in 1973 in the nordic system of labour market regulation the governments legislative role is limited in the same way as in the anglo-saxon system however in contrast to the countries in the anglo-saxon system category this is a much more widespread network of collective agreements which covers most industries and most firms this model was said to encompass denmark finland norway and sweden here denmark joined the eu in 1973 whereas finland and sweden joined in 1995 the united states takes a more laissez-faire approach setting some minimum standards but leaving most workers wages and benefits to collective bargaining and market forces thus it comes closest to the above anglo-saxon model also the eastern european countries that have recently entered into the eu come closest to the anglo-saxon model in contrast in germany the relation between individual employees and employers is considered to be asymmetrical in consequence many working conditions are not negotiable due to a strong legal protection of individuals however the german flavor or works legislation has as its main objective to create a balance of power between employees organized in unions and employers organized in employers associations this allows much wider legal boundaries for collective bargaining compared to the narrow boundaries for individual negotiations as a condition to obtain the legal status of a trade union employee associations need to prove that their leverage is strong enough to serve as a counterforce in negotiations with employers if such an employees association is competing against another union its leverage may be questioned by unions and then evaluated in a court trial in germany only very few professional associations obtained the right to negotiate salaries and

with actual shooting planned in different locations another reason may be tapping into each home market in the case of an international co-production however for the top leading roles whose presence is of enormous commercial importance follow a different sort of protocol during this time known as the attachment phase of a film the casting directors job is to send out copies of the current script to agents for what is known as coverage coverage is when a script yet to be cast is read summarized into a one-pager and a brief set of character descriptions established at this time if an agency agrees to give coverage to a film they will submit a list of ideas to the casting directors of actors available capable and in the price range of the film also casting directors create their own idea lists and can check avails or call the talents representation to see if they are available and interested in taking on potential projects if an idea that is generated from a casting director and a subsequent avail check or from an agents recommendation is approved by the director producers and financiers or studio the casting director sends out what is called an offer the offer usually contains a letter to the actors representative explaining the role in question a copy of the script why the actor has been selected the length of time commitment the approximate start date of filming the filming location and the proposed salary offering if the actor does not respond to the material or for whatever reason cannot accept the job they respond to casting with what is called a pass if they accept the offer the agent engages the casting director and a deal memo is sent from casting to the representative it is at this time when negotiations between agency and production happen to finalize any deal points before the entertainment lawyers step in and draw up the attachment contracts if this process happens very early on in the development of a movie but the official shoot dates and details are not yet known a letter of intent or loi is drafted to indicate if and when the project is green lit or begins active production the actor is already hired to portray that particular role after the attachment phase is complete which depends on many factors including but not limited to financial backers studio heads availability of other above the line personnel the physical auditions begin for all of the remaining roles during this time depending on the budget of the film they could have what is called pre-screens where you audition only for a casting director or associate to see if the actor is right for the material after pre-screens would be a director session during this time the actor comes in and auditions usually with the same material and now performs for the casting director and the film director if there is a next step it is usually a callback or producer session where anyone who has decision making power is in the room for your audition in television this phase is referred to as a screen test and network executives would also be in attendance once talent are selected from the pool of available actors the same booking process that happens in the attachment phase takes place for any featured talent except extras or background talent the resulting list of actors who were selected to play a character for a production is called a cast list which is incorporated into a production company s daily call sheet and reflected in the projects title sequence especially with film and television casting office personnel edit readers this person reads all

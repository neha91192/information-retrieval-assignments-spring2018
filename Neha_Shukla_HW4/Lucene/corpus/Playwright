playwright wikipedia a playwright or dramatist rarely dramaturg e is a person who writes plays etymology edit the term is not a variant spelling of the common misspelling playwrite the word wright is an archaic english term for a craftsman or builder as in a wheelwright or cartwright hence the prefix and the suffix combine to indicate someone who has wrought words themes and other elements into a dramatic form someone who crafts plays the homophone with write is entirely coincidental the first written record of the term playwright is from 1605 73 years before the first written record of the term dramatist it appears to have been first used in a pejorative sense by ben jonson in 1853 to suggest a mere tradesman fashioning works for the theatre jonson described himself as a poet not a playwright since plays during that time were written in meter and so were regarded as the province of poets this view was held as late as the early 19th century the term playwright later again lost this negative connotation history edit early playwrights edit the earliest playwright in western literature with surviving works are the ancient greeks these early plays were for annual athenian competitions among play writers held around the 5th century bc such notables as aeschylus sophocles euripides and aristophanes established forms still relied on by their modern counterparts for the ancient greeks playwriting involved po√Øesis the act of making this is the source of the english word poet aristotles poetics techniques edit in the 4th century bce aristotle wrote his poetics the first play-writing manual in this famous text aristotle established the principle of action or praxis as the basis for all drama he then included a hierarchy of elements for the drama beginning with plot mythos character ethos thought dianoia diction lexis music melodia and spectacle opsis the ends of drama were plot character and thought the means of drama were language and music and the manner of presentation a spectacle since the myths upon which greek tragedy were based were widely known plot had to do with the arrangement and selection of existing material character was equated with choice rather than psychology so that character was determined by action in tragedy the notion of ethical choice determined the character of the individual thought had more to do and the imitation of an action that is serious and so forth brought with it the concept of mimesis from real life thus he developed his notion of hamartia or tragic flaw an error in judgment by the main character or protagonist it provides the basis for the conflict-driven play a term still held as the sine qua non of dramaturgy the poetics while very brief and highly condensed is still studied today perhaps the most aristotelian of contemporary playwrights is david mamet who embraces the idea of character as agent of the action and emphasizes causality in the structure of his plays his recently revived speed-the-plow is quintessentially aristotelian in that it both observes the unities with exception of act is change in place and builds its plot through a causal stream of discoveries and reversals neo-classical theory edit william shakespeare the italian renaissance brought about a stricter interpretation of aristotle as this long-lost work came to light in the late 15th century the neoclassical ideal which was to reach its apogee in france during the 17th century dwelled upon the unities of action place and time this meant that the playwright had to construct the play so that its virtual time would not exceed 24 hours that it would be restricted to a single setting and that there would be no subplots other terms such as verisimilitude and decorum circumscribed the subject matter significantly for example verisimilitude limits of the unities decorum fitted proper protocols for behavior and language on stage in france contained too many events and actions thus violating the 24-hour restriction of the unity of time neoclassicism never had as much traction in england and shakespeare s plays are directly opposed to these models while in italy improvised and bawdy commedia dellarte and opera were more popular forms in england after the interregnum and restoration of the monarchy in 1660 there was a move toward neoclassical dramaturgy one structural unit that is still useful to playwrights today is the french scene which is a scene in a play where the beginning and end are marked by a change in the makeup of the group of characters onstage rather than by the lights going up or down or the set being changed well-made play edit popularized in the nineteenth century by the french playwrights eugene scribe and victorien sardou and perhaps the most schematic of all formats the well-made play relies on a series of coincidences for better or worse that determined the action this plot driven format is often reliant on a prop device such as a glass of water or letter that reveals some secret information in most cases the character receiving the secret information misinterprets its contents thus setting off a chain of events well-made plays are thus motivated by various plot devices which lead to discoveries and reversals of action rather than being character motivated henrik ibsen s a dolls house is an example of a well-made structure built around the discovery of krogstads letter that began to integrate a more realistic approach to character ironically the character noras leaving is as much motivated by the letter and disclosure of a past secret as it is by her own determination to strike out on her own the well-made play infiltrated other forms of writing and is still seen in popular formats such as the mystery or whodunit play formats edit full-length play generally two or three acts with an act break intermission or interval that marks some kind of scene change or time shift usually these acts are divided into scenes which are also defined by shifts in time and place this type of structure is called episodic episodic plays often contain scene changes and require careful attention to transitions so as to maintain entails a more causal relationship between units and is often defined by the unity of time place and or action short play a more popular format recently the short play does not have an intermission and generally runs over an hour but less than an hour-and-a-half one-act play a useful form for experimental work the absurdists made the form popular with less reliance on character development and arc generally these remain under an hour in length in the us the 10-minute play has been popularized over the past 20 years and with beginning playwrights since the format requires rigor such a format can be processed or produced without onerous technical requirements contemporary playwrights in america edit contemporary playwrights in the united states often do not reach the same level of fame or cultural importance as others did in the past no longer the only outlet for serious drama or entertaining comedies theatrical productions must use ticket sales as a source of income has caused many of them to reduce the number of new works being produced for example playwrights horizons produced only six plays in the 2002 03 seasons compared with thirty-one in 197374 as revivals and large-scale production musicals become the de rigueur of broadway and even off-broadway productions playwrights find it difficult to earn a living in the business let alone achieve major successes new play development in america edit in an effort to develop new american voices in playwriting a phenomenon known as new play development began to emerge in the early-to-mid-1980s and continues through today many regional theatres have hired dramaturges and literary managers in an effort to showcase various festivals for new work or bring in playwrights for residencies funding through national organizations such as the national endowment for the arts and the theatre communications group encouraged the partnerships of professional theatre companies and emerging playwrights and fast rule about this new dramatists and the lark in new york for example will often have a cold reading of a script in an informal sitdown setting a cold reading means that the actors havent rehearsed the work or may be seeing it for the first time and usually the technical requirements are minimal shenandoah and the oneill festival offer summer retreats for playwrights to develop their work with directors and actors in a totally devoted setting there has been a backlash over the past ten years with the formation of playwriting collectives like 13p and clubbed thumb who have gathered members together to produce rather than develop new works this has been a reaction to the developed to death notion in which the play never gets produced but goes through endless readings and critiques that after a certain point in new york go through some kind of assiduous development process and rare is the play that shows up on a producers desk that gains any traction on broadway this has happened in the past year with martin mcdonagh s a behanding in spokane and mamet s race although these shows were packaged with stars christopher walken in the former and with playwrights who are well established in the profession
